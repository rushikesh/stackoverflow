Here is some basic information on how each of the major HTML5 tags can/should be used (I suggest reading the full source linked at the bottom): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>section</em></strong> – Used for grouping together thematically-related content. Sounds like a div element, but it’s not. The div has no semantic meaning. Before replacing all your div’s with section elements, always ask yourself: “Is all of the content related?”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>aside</em></strong> – Used for tangentially related content. Just because some content appears to the left or right of the main content isn’t enough reason to use the aside element. Ask yourself if the content within the aside can be removed without reducing the meaning of the main content. Pullquotes are an example of tangentially related content.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>header</em></strong> – There is a crucial difference between the header element and the general accepted usage of header (or masthead). There’s usually only one header or ‘masthead’ in a page. In HTML5 you can have as many as you want. The spec defines it as “a group of introductory or navigational aids”. You can use a header in any section on your site. In fact, you probably should use a header within most of your sections. The spec describes the section element as “a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>nav</em></strong> – Intended for major navigation information. A group of links grouped together isn’t enough reason to use the nav element. Site-wide navigation, on the other hand belongs in a nav element.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>footer</em></strong> – Sounds like its a description of the position, but its not. Footer elements contain informations about its containing element: who wrote it, copyright, links to related content, etc. Whereas we usually have one footer for an entire document, HTML5 allows us to also have footer within sections.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.anthonycalzadilla.com/2010/08/html5-section-aside-header-nav-footer-elements-not-as-obvious-as-they-sound/\">http://www.anthonycalzadilla.com/2010/08/html5-section-aside-header-nav-footer-elements-not-as-obvious-as-they-sound/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n    "},{"t":"What is the difference between <section> and <div>?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939864/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div","q":"\n\n<p>What is the difference between <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in HTML?

A good example of an application that could use websockets is a chat application.</p>\n\n<p>SSE connections can only push data to the browser. Online stock quotes, or twitters updating timeline or feed are good examples of an application that could benefit from SSE.</p>\n\n<p>In practice since everything that can be done with SSE can also be done with Websockets, Websockets is getting a lot more attention and love, and many more browsers support Websockets than SSE.</p>\n\n<p>However, it can be overkill for some types of application, and the backend could be easier to implement with a protocol such as SSE. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore SSE can be polyfilled into older browsers that do not support it natively using just JavaScript.

From that page:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h1>Server-Sent Events vs. WebSockets</h1>\n  \n  <p>Why would you choose Server-Sent Events over WebSockets? Good question.</p>\n  \n  <p>One reason SSEs have been kept in the shadow is because later APIs like WebSockets provide a richer protocol to perform bi-directional, full-duplex communication. Having a two-way channel is more attractive for things like games, messaging apps, and for cases where you need near real-time updates in both directions. However, in some scenarios data doesn't need to be sent from the client. You simply need updates from some server action. A few examples would be friends' status updates, stock tickers, news feeds, or other automated data push mechanisms (e.g. updating a client-side Web SQL Database or IndexedDB object store). If you'll need to send data to a server, XMLHttpRequest is always a friend.</p>\n  \n  <p>SSEs are sent over traditional HTTP. That means they do not require a special protocol or server implementation to get working. WebSockets on the other hand, require full-duplex connections and new Web Socket servers to handle the protocol. In addition, Server-Sent Events have a variety of features that WebSockets lack by design such as automatic reconnection, event IDs, and the ability to send arbitrary events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>TLDR summary:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of SSE over Websockets:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Transported over simple HTTP instead of a custom protocol</li>\n<li>Can be poly-filled with javascript to \"backport\" SSE to browsers that do not support it yet.</li>\n<li>Built in support for re-connection and event-id</li>\n<li>Simpler protocol</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of Websockets over SSE:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Real time, two directional communication.</li>\n<li>Native suport in more browers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Ideal use cases of SSE:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stock ticker streaming</li>\n<li>twitter feed updating</li>\n<li>Notifications to browser</li>\n</ul>\n    "},{"t":"What browsers support HTML5 WebSocket API?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1253683/what-browsers-support-html5-websocket-api","q":"\n\n<p>I am going to develop an instant messaging application that runs in the browser.</p>\n\n<p>What browsers support the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket\">WebSocket API</a>?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<h2>Client side</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hixie-75:\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome 4.0 + 5.0</li>\n<li>Safari 5.0.0</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>HyBi-00/Hixie-76:\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome 6.0 - 13.0</li>\n<li>Safari 5.0.2 + 5.1</li>\n<li>iOS 4.2 + iOS 5</li>\n<li>Firefox 4.0 - <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/WebSockets\">support for WebSockets disabled</a>.

The obstacle I've run into now is how to play sound effects.</p>\n\n<p>The game is a port of an old Macintosh game, and because of its age, the requirements are few in number:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Play and mix multiple sounds,</li>\n<li>Play the same sample multiple times, possibly overlapping playbacks</li>\n<li>Interrupt playback of a sample at any point</li>\n<li>Preferably play WAV files containing (low quality) raw PCM, but I can convert these, of course</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My first approach was to use the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element and define all sound effects in my page. Firefox plays the WAV files just peachy, but calling #play multiple times doesn't really play the sample multiple times. From my understanding of the HTML5 spec, the &lt;audio&gt; element also tracks playback state, so that explains why.</p>\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to clone the audio elements, so I created the following tiny javascript library to do that for me (depends on jquery):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Snd = {\n  init: function() {\n    $(\"audio\").each(function() {\n      var src = this.getAttribute('src');\n      if (src.substring(0, 4) !== \"snd/\") { return; }\n      // Cut out the basename (strip directory and extension)\n      var name = src.substring(4, src.length - 4);\n      // Create the helper function, which clones the audio object and plays it\n      var Constructor = function() {};\n      Constructor.prototype = this;\n      Snd[name] = function() {\n        var clone = new Constructor();\n        clone.play();\n        // Return the cloned element, so the caller can interrupt the sound effect\n        return clone;\n      };\n    });\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now I can do <em>Snd.boom();</em> from the Firebug console and play 'snd/boom.wav'. Neat. But I still can't play the same sample multiple times. It seems that the &lt;audio&gt; element is really more of a streaming feature rather than something to play sound effects with.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a clever way to make this happen that I'm missing? Preferebly something within HTML5 and Javascript, because this experiment is focused on these two technologies. (And I lack any experience in Flash or Silverlight.)</p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that, my test environment is Firefox 3.5 on Ubuntu 9.10.

The rows are still being added and removed as the user is scrolling, but the scrolling itself is done by the browser.  That allows it to be very fast yet smooth (onscroll events are notoriously slow).  The caveat is that there are bugs/limits in the browsers' CSS engines that limit the potential height of an element.  For IE, that happens to be 0x123456 or 1193046 pixels.  For other browsers it is higher.  </p>\n\n<p>There is an experimental workaround in the \"largenum-fix\" branch that raises that limit significantly by populating the scrollable area with \"pages\" set to 1M pixels height and then using relative positioning within those pages.

You should read this answer even if you are using jQuery Mobile 1.4 +, it goes beyond page events so you will probably find a lot of useful information. </p>\n\n<h3>Older content:</h3>\n\n<p>This article can also be found as a part of my blog <strong><a href=\"http://www.gajotres.net/document-onpageinit-vs-document-ready/\">HERE</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<h1>$(document).on('pageinit') vs $(document).ready()</h1>\n\n<p>The first thing you learn in <strong>jQuery</strong> is to call code inside the <strong>$(document).ready()</strong> function so everything will execute as soon as the DOM is loaded. However, in <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong>, Ajax is used to load the contents of each page into the DOM as you navigate. Because of this <strong>$(document).ready()</strong> will trigger before your first page is loaded and every code intended for page manipulation will be executed after a page refresh. This can be a very subtle bug. On some systems it may appear that it works fine, but on others it may cause erratic, difficult to repeat weirdness to occur.</p>\n\n<p>Classic jQuery syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { \n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To solve this problem (and trust me this is a problem) <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> developers created page events. In a nutshell page events are events triggered in a particular point of page execution. One of those page events is a <strong>pageinit</strong> event and we can use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pageinit', function() {\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can go even further and use a page id instead of document selector. Lets say we have jQuery Mobile page with an id <strong>index</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"index\"&gt;\n    &lt;div data-theme=\"a\" data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n        &lt;h3&gt;\n            First Page\n        &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#second\" class=\"ui-btn-right\"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#\" data-role=\"button\" id=\"test-button\"&gt;Test button&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;div data-theme=\"a\" data-role=\"footer\" data-position=\"fixed\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To execute a code that will only available to the index page we could use this syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#index').on('pageinit', function() {\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Pageinit</strong> event will be executed every time page is about be be loaded and shown for the first time. It will not trigger again unless page is manually refreshed or ajax page loading is turned off. In case you want code to execute every time you visit a page it is better to use <strong>pagebeforeshow</strong> event.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a working example : <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Q3Usv/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Q3Usv/</a> to demonstrate this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Few more notes on this question. No matter if you are using 1 html multiple pages or multiple html files paradigm it is advised to separate all of your custom javascript page handling into a single separate js file. This will note make your code any better but you will have much better code overview, especially while creating a <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> application.</p>\n\n<p>There's also another special <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> event and it is called <strong>mobileinit</strong>.When <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> starts, it triggers a <strong>mobileinit</strong> event on the document object. To override default settings, bind them to <strong>mobileinit</strong>. One of a good examples of <strong>mobileinit</strong> usage is turning off ajax page loading, or changing default ajax loader behavior.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on(\"mobileinit\", function(){\n  //apply overrides here\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Page events transition order</h2>\n\n<p>First all events can be found here: <a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/\">http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/</a></p>\n\n<p>Lets say we have a page A and a page B, this is a unload/load order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforecreate/\">pagebeforecreate</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecreate/\">pagecreate</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/\">pageinit</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforehide/\">pagebeforehide</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageremove/\">pageremove</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page A - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagehide/\">pagehide</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforeshow/\">pagebeforeshow</a></strong></p></li>\n<li><p>page B - event <strong><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageshow/\">pageshow</a></strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>For better page events understanding read this:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>pagebeforeload</code></strong>, <strong><code>pageload</code></strong> and <strong><code>pageloadfailed</code></strong> are fired when an external page is loaded</li>\n<li><strong><code>pagebeforechange</code></strong>, <strong><code>pagechange</code></strong> and <strong><code>pagechangefailed</code></strong> are page change events.

Depending on how you managed to bind your events each time you visit some page it will bind events over and over. This is not an error, it is simply how <strong><code>jQuery Mobile</code></strong> handles its pages. For example, take a look at this code snipet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow','#index' ,function(e,data){    \n    $(document).on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        alert('Button click');\n    });    \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/CCfL4/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/CCfL4/</a></p>\n\n<p>Each time you visit page <strong>#index</strong> click event will is going to be bound to button <strong>#test-button</strong>. Test it by moving from page 1 to page 2 and back several times. There are few ways to prevent this problem:</p>\n\n<h3>Solution 1</h3>\n\n<p>Best solution would be to use <strong><code>pageinit</code></strong> to bind events. If you take a look at an official documentation you will find out that <strong><code>pageinit</code></strong> will trigger ONLY once, just like document ready, so there's no way events will be bound again. This is best solution because you don't have processing overhead like when removing events with off method.</p>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/AAFH8/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/AAFH8/</a></p>\n\n<p>This working solution is made on a basis of a previous problematic example.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution 2</h3>\n\n<p>Remove event before you bind it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', '#index', function(){       \n    $(document).off('click', '#test-button').on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        alert('Button click');\n    }); \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/K8YmG/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/K8YmG/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Solution 3</h3>\n\n<p>Use a jQuery Filter selector, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#carousel div:Event(!click)').each(function(){\n    //If click is not bind to #carousel div do something\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because event filter is not a part of official jQuery framework it can be found here:   <a href=\"http://www.codenothing.com/archives/2009/event-filter/\">http://www.codenothing.com/archives/2009/event-filter/</a></p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, if speed is your main concern then <strong>Solution 2</strong> is much better then Solution 1. </p>\n\n<h3>Solution 4</h3>\n\n<p>A new one, probably an easiest of them all.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', '#index', function(){       \n    $(document).on('click', '#test-button',function(e) {\n        if(e.handled !== true) // This will prevent event triggering more then once\n        {\n            alert('Clicked');\n            e.handled = true;\n        }\n    }); \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Working jsFiddle example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Yerv9/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/Yerv9/</a></p>\n\n<p>Tnx to the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/89789/sholsinger\">sholsinger</a> for this solution: <a href=\"http://sholsinger.com/archive/2011/08/prevent-jquery-live-handlers-from-firing-multiple-times/\">http://sholsinger.com/archive/2011/08/prevent-jquery-live-handlers-from-firing-multiple-times/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>pageChange event quirks - triggering twice</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes pagechange event can trigger twice and it does not have anything to do with the problem mentioned before.</p>\n\n<p>The reason the pagebeforechange event occurs twice is due to the recursive call in changePage when toPage is not a jQuery enhanced DOM object. This recursion is dangerous, as the developer is allowed to change the toPage within the event. If the developer consistently sets toPage to a string, within the pagebeforechange event handler, regardless of whether or not it was an object an infinite recursive loop will result. The pageload event passes the new page as the page property of the data object (This should be added to the documentation, it's not listed currently). The pageload event could therefore be used to access the loaded page.</p>\n\n<p>In few words this is happening because you are sending additional parameters through pageChange. </p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a data-role=\"button\" data-icon=\"arrow-r\" data-iconpos=\"right\" href=\"#care-plan-view?id=9e273f31-2672-47fd-9baa-6c35f093a800&amp;amp;name=Sat\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To fix this problem use any page event listed in <strong>Page events transition order</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Page Change Times</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned, when you change from one JQuery Mobile page to another, typically either through clicking on a link to another JQuery Mobile page that already exists in the DOM, or by manually calling $.mobile.changePage, several events and subsequent actions occur. At a high level the following actions occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A page change process is begun</li>\n<li>A new page is loaded</li>\n<li>The content for that page is “enhanced” (styled)</li>\n<li>A transition (slide/pop/etc) from the existing page to the new page occurs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a average page transition benchmark:</p>\n\n<p>Page load and processing: <strong>3ms</strong>\nPage enhance: <strong>45ms</strong>\nTransition: <strong>604ms</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total time: <strong>670ms</strong>   *These values are in milliseconds.</p>\n\n<p>So as you can see a transition event is eating almost 90% of execution time.</p>\n\n<h2>Data/Parameters manipulation between page transitions</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible to send a parameter/s from one page to another during page transition. It can be done in few ways.</p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13932240/1848600\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13932240/1848600</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can pass values with changePage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.mobile.changePage('page2.html', { dataUrl : \"page2.html?paremeter=123\", data : { 'paremeter' : '123' }, reloadPage : true, changeHash : true });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And read them like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#index\", function (event, data) {\n    var parameters = $(this).data(\"url\").split(\"?\")[1];;\n    parameter = parameters.replace(\"parameter=\",\"\");  \n    alert(parameter);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/15840673/1848600\">Example</a>:</h3>\n\n<p><strong>index.html</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n  &lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"widdiv=device-widdiv, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://www.dragan-gaic.info/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  \n    &lt;script&gt;\n        $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#index\",function () {\n            $(document).on('click', \"#changePage\",function () {     \n                $.mobile.changePage('second.html', { dataUrl : \"second.html?paremeter=123\", data : { 'paremeter' : '123' }, reloadPage : false, changeHash : true });\n            }); \n        }); \n\n        $(document).on('pagebeforeshow', \"#second\",function () {\n            var parameters = $(this).data(\"url\").split(\"?\")[1];;\n            parameter = parameters.replace(\"parameter=\",\"\");  \n            alert(parameter);\n        });         \n    &lt;/script&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Home --&gt;\n    &lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"index\"&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;\n                First Page\n            &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n          &lt;a data-role=\"button\" id=\"changePage\"&gt;Test&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--content--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--page--&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>second.html</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n  &lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"widdiv=device-widdiv, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;\n    &lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://www.dragan-gaic.info/js/jquery-1.8.2.min.js\"&gt;\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  \n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Home --&gt;\n    &lt;div data-role=\"page\" id=\"second\"&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"header\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3&gt;\n                Second Page\n            &lt;/h3&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div data-role=\"content\"&gt;\n\n        &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!--content--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--page--&gt;\n\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Or you can create a persistent javascript object for a storage purpose.

It only works with HTML5 browsers (including Android and iOS browsers) but all stored data is persistent through page refresh.</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(typeof(Storage)!==\"undefined\") {\n    localStorage.firstname=\"Dragan\";\n    localStorage.lastname=\"Gaic\";            \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/J9NTr/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/J9NTr/</a></p>\n\n<p>Probably best solution but it will fail in some versions of iOS 5.X. It is a well know error.</p>\n\n<h2>Don’t Use .live() / .bind() /.delegate()</h2>\n\n<p>I forgot to mention (and tnx <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/64262/andleer\">andleer</a> for reminding me) use on/off for event binding/unbinding, live/die and bind/unbind are deprecated.</p>\n\n<p>The .live() method of jQuery was seen as a godsend when it was introduced to the API in version 1.3. In a typical jQuery app there can be a lot of DOM manipulation and it can become very tedious to hook and unhook as elements come and go. The .live() method made it possible to hook an event for the life of the app based on its selector. Great right? Wrong, the .live() method is extremely slow. The .live() method actually hooks its events to the document object, which means that the event must bubble up from the element that generated the event until it reaches the document. This can be amazingly time consuming.</p>\n\n<p>It is now deprecated. The folks on the jQuery team no longer recommend its use and neither do I. Even though it can be tedious to hook and unhook events, your code will be much faster without the .live() method than with it.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of <strong>.live()</strong> you should use <strong>.on()</strong>. <strong>.on()</strong> is about 2-3x faster then <strong>.live()</strong>. Take a look at this event binding benchmark: <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-delegate-vs-on/34\">http://jsperf.com/jquery-live-vs-delegate-vs-on/34</a>, everything will be clear from there.</p>\n\n<h2>Benchmarking:</h2>\n\n<p>There's an excellent script made for <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> page events benchmarking. It can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tools/page-change-time.js\">https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tools/page-change-time.js</a>. But before you do anything with it I advise you to remove its <strong>alert</strong> notification system (each “change page” is going to show you this data by halting the app) and change it to <strong>console.log</strong> function.</p>\n\n<p>Basically this script will log all your page events and if you read this article carefully (page events descriptions) you will know how much time jQm spent of page enhancements, page transitions ....</p>\n\n<h2>Final notes</h2>\n\n<p>Always, and I mean always read official <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> documentation.

By default this allows you to keep much better track of the elements you create and makes dealing with things like mouse events easier by default, but it slows down significantly when there are a large number of objects</p>\n\n<p>Those SVG DOM references mean that some of the footwork of dealing with the things you draw is done for you. And SVG is faster when rendering <em>really large</em> objects, but slower when rendering <em>many</em> objects.</p>\n\n<p>A game would probably be faster in Canvas. A huge map program would probably be faster in SVG. If you do want to use Canvas, I have some tutorials on getting movable objects up and running <a href=\"http://simonsarris.com/blog/510-making-html5-canvas-useful\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Canvas would be better for faster things and heavy bitmap manipulation (like animation), but will take more code if you want lots of interactivity.</p>\n\n<p>I've run a bunch of numbers on HTML DIV-made drawing versus Canvas-made drawing. I could make a huge post about the benefits of each, but I will give some of the relevant results of my tests to consider for your specific application:</p>\n\n<p>I made Canvas and HTML DIV test pages, both had movable \"nodes.\" Canvas nodes were objects I created and kept track of in Javascript. HTML nodes were movable Divs.</p>\n\n<p>I added 100,000 nodes to each of my two tests. They performed quite differently:</p>\n\n<p>The HTML test tab took forever to load (timed at slightly under 5 minutes, chrome asked to kill the page the first time). Chrome's task manager says that tab is taking up 168MB. It takes up 12-13% CPU time when I am looking at it, 0% when I am not looking.</p>\n\n<p>The Canvas tab loaded in one second and takes up 30MB. It also takes up 13% of CPU time all of the time, regardless of whether or not one is looking at it. <em>(2013 edit: They've mostly fixed that)</em></p>\n\n<p>Dragging on the HTML page is smoother, which is expected by the design, since the current setup is to redraw EVERYTHING every 30 milliseconds in the Canvas test. There are plenty of optimizations to be had for Canvas for this. (canvas invalidation being the easiest, also clipping regions, selective redrawing, etc.. just depends on how much you feel like implementing)</p>\n\n<p>There is no doubt you could get Canvas to be faster at object manipulation as the divs in that simple test, and of course far faster in the load time. Drawing/loading is faster in Canvas and has far more room for optimizations, too (ie, excluding things that are off-screen is very easy).</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SVG is probably better for applications and apps with few items (less than 1000? Depends really)</li>\n<li>Canvas is better for thousands of objects and careful manipulation, but a lot more code (or a library) is needed to get it off the ground.</li>\n<li>HTML Divs are clunky and do not scale, making a circle is only possible with rounded corners, making complex shapes is possible but involves hundreds of tiny tiny pixel-wide divs. Madness ensues.</li>\n</ul>\n    "},{"t":"Using HTML5/Javascript to generate and save a file","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2897619/using-html5-javascript-to-generate-and-save-a-file","q":"\n\n<p>I've been fiddling with WebGL lately, and have gotten a Collada reader working.

The example map above is what the player sees in their minimap. Onscreen they see a rendered version of the section marked by the white rectangle; where the tiles are rendered with their images rather than as single color pixels.</p>\n\n<p>This is an example of what the user would see in the map but <em>it is not the same location as the viewport above shows!</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/F0f9E.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>It is in this view that I want the transitioning to occur.</p>\n\n<h2>The Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>I came up with a simple algorithm that would traverse the map within the viewport and render another image over the top of each tile, providing it was next to a tile of different type. (Not changing the map! Just rendering some extra images.) The idea of the algorithm was to profile the current tile's neighbors:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cetyi.png\" alt=\"An example of a tile profile\"></p>\n\n<p>This is an example scenario of what the engine might have to render, with the current tile being the one marked with the X.</p>\n\n<p>A 3x3 array is created and the values around it are read in. So for this example the array would look like.</p>\n\n<pre><code>[\n    [1,2,2]\n    [1,2,2]\n    [1,1,2]\n];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My idea was then to work out a series of cases for the possible tile configurations. On a very simple level:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(profile[0][1] != profile[1][1]){\n     //draw a tile which is half sand and half transparent\n     //Over the current tile -&gt; profile[1][1]\n     ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which gives this result:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/R4UPM.png\" alt=\"Result\"></p>\n\n<p>Which works as a transition from <code>[0][1]</code> to <code>[1][1]</code>, but not from <code>[1][1]</code> to <code>[2][1]</code>, where a hard edge remains. So I figured that in that instance a corner tile would have to be used. I created two 3x3 sprite sheets that I thought would hold all the possible combinations of tiles that could be needed. Then I replicated this for all of the tiles that there are in the game (The white areas are transparent).

In the example below the <em>edge tiles</em> marked with an X are all green tiles with a tan tile as one or more of their eight neighbouring tiles. With different types of terrain this condition could translate to a tile being an edge tile if it has neighbours of lower terrain-number.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/X4Kyx.png\" alt=\"Edge tiles.\"></p>\n\n<p>Once all edge tiles are detected the next thing to do is to select the right smoothing tile for each edge tile. Here is my representation of your smoothing tiles.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0VXxS.png\" alt=\"Smoothing tiles.\"></p>\n\n<p>Note that there are actually not that many different types of tiles. We need the eight outer tiles from one of the 3x3 squares but only the four corner squares from the other since the straight-edge tiles are already found in the first square. This means that there in total are 12 different cases we must distinguish between.</p>\n\n<p>Now, looking at one edge tile we can determine which way the boundary turns by looking at its four closest neighbour tiles. Marking an edge tile with X just as above we have the following six different cases.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BRgLf.png\" alt=\"Six cases.\"></p>\n\n<p>These cases are used to determine the corresponding smoothing tile and we can number the smoothing tiles accordingly.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qGuxN.png\" alt=\"Smoothed tiles with numbers.\"></p>\n\n<p>There is still a choice of a or b for each case. This depends on which side the grass is on. One way to determine this could be to keep track of the orientation of the boundary but probably the simplest way to do it is to pick one tile next to the edge and see what colour it has. The image below shows the two cases 5a) and 5b) which can be distinguished between by for example checking the colour of the top right tile.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/3sgIZ.png\" alt=\"Choosing 5a or 5b.\"> </p>\n\n<p>The final enumeration for the original example would then look like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oniTS.png\" alt=\"Final enumeration.\"></p>\n\n<p>And after selecting the corresponding edge tile the border would look something like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fYBDR.png\" alt=\"Final result.\"></p>\n\n<p>As a final note I might say that this would work as long as the boundary is somewhat regular. More precisely, edge tiles that do not have exactly two edge tiles as their neighbours will have to be treated separately. This will occur for edge tiles on the edge of the map which will have a single edge neighbour and for very narrow pieces of terrain where the number of neighbouring edge tiles could be three or even four.</p>\n    "},{"t":"HTML5 Input Type Date — Default Value to Today?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6982692/html5-input-type-date-default-value-to-today","q":"\n\n<p>The new HTML5 input types are great.

The client browser interprets the markup and renders (with varying degrees of success) the page according to an standard specification.</li>\n<li>Adobe Flash is a propriety framework for working with audio, video, sound and raster/vector graphics.  It requires special authoring tools (a compiler perhaps?) and a custom player that's available as a plug-in to most common browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Could someone please explain (to this C/C++ developer) how it is possible <em>from a technical/coding point-of-view</em> that a text-based markup language (HTML5) could be considered a replacement to a multimedia framework (Flash)? </p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Please no opinionated arguments - just technical facts.</strong></em></p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>What people loosely refer to HTML5 in the context of this discussion is the combination of HTML as a markup language, CSS which specifies how it is rendered, and the javascript code which manipulates the HTML and CSS dynamically.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, HTML5 not only has the standard text elements, but also <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> on which 2d graphics can be drawn, and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements which embeds the video (as the name suggests).  </p>\n\n<p>So, in a full-fledged implementation of HTML5, you can implement dynamic web sites without using Flash.

A number of thoughts race through my head about the subject:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How many mobile devices are actually able to decode video at a decent speed anyway, Flash or otherwise?</li>\n<li>How long until mainstream mobile devices get the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> support? Even if it is available through updates, how many people actually do that?</li>\n<li>How many people watch videos on web pages on their mobile phones at all?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for the semantics part - I understand that search engines might be able to detect videos better now, but... what will they do with them anyway? OK, so they know that there is a video in the page. And? They can't index a video! I'd like some more arguments here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just thought of another Cons. This opens up a whole new area of cross-browser incompatibility. HTML and CSS is quite messy already in this aspect. Flash at least is the same everywhere. But it's enough for at least one major browser vendor to decide against the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag (can anyone say \"Internet Explorer\"?) and we have a nice new area of hell to explore.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Pro just came in. More competition = more innovation. That's true. Giving Adobe more competition will probably force them to improve Flash in areas it has been lacking so far. Linux seems to be a weak spot for it, cited by many.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>There are many good points here, and like a Martial Arts fighting style, each point has its thrust, and each can be defended; but each can be defeated with the proper moves. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone standing on arguments about \"propietary\" plugins will fall quickly. Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe all bear the guilt, but that's just BUSINESS. You won't change business overnight, and each layer of complexity added by a new tag such as &lt;video&gt;  which supports a very technical interface will result in * slightly * different implementations by each browser. </p>\n\n<p>HTML 5 works now, and so does Flash. <strong>How</strong> it is implemented, the skill it requires- this defines each resource, whether it's an employee's performance, a webmaster's power, or a domain's influence. </p>\n\n<p>Although I'm only 40, I began programming when orange or green monochrome monitors were the color choice, and hardware installation came with prayer books instead of instruction manuals. Maybe you could figure out AT commands for the modem when it wouldn't configure with your hardware, and 64K RAM was like, WOWWWWW!</p>\n\n<p>HTML 5/Flash is a minor nuisance compared to that crap. Let's all learn how to collaborate in community toward a better resource. There is an Open Source Flash Project, it will have bugs. So will HTML 5...</p>\n\n<p>Every argument here is true, but not necessarily productive. Use that energy toward a solution.  </p>\n    "},{"t":"The data-toggle attributes in Twitter Bootstrap","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15113537/the-data-toggle-attributes-in-twitter-bootstrap","q":"\n\n<p>What does <code>data-toggle</code> attributes do in Twitter Bootstrap?

Now due to WebSockets, \nLong Polling is going away. And WebRTC allows peer-to-peer communication.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend learning <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets\">WebSockets</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Comparison:</h1>\n\n<p><em>of different communication techniques in web</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>AJAX</strong> - <code>request</code> → <code>response</code>. Creates connection to server, sends request headers with optional data, gets response from server, closes connection. <em>Supported in all major browsers.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Long poll</strong> - <code>request</code> → <code>wait</code> → <code>response</code>. Creates connection to server like AJAX does, but keep-alive connection open for some time (not long though), during connection open client can receive data from server. Client have to reconnect periodically after connection is closed due to timeouts or data eof. On server side it is still treated like HTTP request same as AJAX, except the answer on request will happen now or some time in the future defined by application logic. <em>Supported in all major browsers.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>WebSockets</strong> - <code>client</code> ↔ <code>server</code>. Create TCP connection to server, and keep it as long as needed. Server or client can easily close it. Client goes through HTTP compatible handshake process, if it succeeds, then server and client can exchange data both directions at any time. It is very efficient if application requires frequent data exchange in both ways. WebSockets do have data framing that includes masking for each message sent from client to server so data is simply encrypted. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(very good)</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>WebRTC</strong> - <code>peer</code> ↔ <code>peer</code>. Transport to establish communication between clients and is transport-agnostic so uses UDP, TCP or even more abstract layers. By design it allows to transport data in reliable as well as unreliable ways. This is generally used for high volume data transfer such as video/audio streaming where reliability - is secondary and few frames or reduction in quality progression can be sacrificed in favour of response time and at least delivering something. Both sides (peers) can push data to each other independently. While it can be used totally independent from any centralised servers it still require some way of exchanging endPoints data, where in most cases developers still use centralised servers to \"link\" peers. This is required only to exchange essential data for connection establishing - after connection is established server on aside is not required. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=webrtc\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(medium)</em></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Server-Sent Events</strong> - <code>client</code> ← <code>server</code>. Client establishes persistent and long-term connection to server. Only server can send data to client. If client wants to send data to server it would require to use other technology/protocol to do so. This protocol is HTTP compatible and simple to implement in most server-side platforms. This is preferable protocol to be used instead of Long Polling. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource\"><em>support chart</em></a> <em>(good, except IE)</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Advantages:</h2>\n\n<p>Main advantage of <strong>WebSockets</strong> for server, is that it is not HTTP request (after handshake), but proper message based communication protocol. That <strong>allows you to achieve huge performance and architecture advantages</strong>. For example in node.js you can share the same memory for different socket connections, so that way they can access shared variables. So you don't need to use database as exchange point in the middle (like with AJAX or Long Polling and for example PHP).\nYou can store data in RAM, or even republish between sockets straight away.</p>\n\n<h2>Security considerations</h2>\n\n<p>People often are concerned regarding security of WebSockets. Reality is that it makes little difference or even puts WebSockets as better option. First of all with AJAX there is a higher chance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">MITM</a> as each request is new TCP connection and traversing through internet infrastructure. With WebSockets, once it's connected it is far more challenging to intercept in between, with additionally enforced frame masking when data is streamed from client to server as well as additional compression, that requires more effort to probe data. <strong>All modern protocols support both: HTTP and HTTPS (encrypted).</strong></p>\n\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Remember that WebSockets generally have a very different approach of logic for networking</strong>, more like real-time games had all this time, and not like http.</p>\n    "},{"t":"How can I write text on a HTML5 canvas element?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3697615/how-can-i-write-text-on-a-html5-canvas-element","q":"\n\n<p>Is it possible to write text on HTML5 <code>canvas</code>? </p>\n    ","a":"\n<pre><code>&lt;canvas id=\"e\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var canvas = document.getElementById(\"e\");\n  var context = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n  context.fillStyle = \"blue\";\n  context.font = \"bold 16px Arial\";\n  context.fillText(\"Zibri\", 100, 100);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    "},{"t":"What is the current state of the art in HTML canvas JavaScript libraries and frameworks?

Neither is there currently an <code>innerSVG</code> property or other way(*) to parse content into an SVGElement. For this reason you should use DOM-style methods. jQuery doesn't give you easy access to the namespaced methods needed to create SVG elements. Really jQuery isn't designed for use with SVG at all and many operations may fail.</p>\n\n<p>HTML5 promises to let you use <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> without an <code>xmlns</code> inside a plain HTML (<code>text/html</code>) document in the future. But this is just a parser hack(**), the SVG content will still be SVGElements in the SVG namespace, and not HTMLElements, so you'll not be able to use <code>innerHTML</code> even though they <em>look</em> like part of an HTML document.</p>\n\n<p>However, for today's browsers you must use *X*HTML (properly served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>; save with the .xhtml file extension for local testing) to get SVG to work at all. (It kind of makes sense to anyway; SVG is a properly XML-based standard.) This means you'd have to escape the <code>&lt;</code> symbols inside your script block (or enclose in a CDATA section), and include the XHTML <code>xmlns</code> declaration. example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"&gt;&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;svg id=\"s\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"/&gt;\n    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n        function makeSVG(tag, attrs) {\n            var el= document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', tag);\n            for (var k in attrs)\n                el.setAttribute(k, attrs[k]);\n            return el;\n        }\n\n        var circle= makeSVG('circle', {cx: 100, cy: 50, r:40, stroke: 'black', 'stroke-width': 2, fill: 'red'});\n        document.getElementById('s').appendChild(circle);\n        circle.onmousedown= function() {\n            alert('hello');\n        };\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>*: well, there's DOM Level 3 LS's <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-LS/load-save.html#LS-LSParser-parseWithContext\">parseWithContext</a>, but browser support is very poor. Edit to add: however, whilst you can't inject markup into an SVGElement, you could inject a new SVGElement into an HTMLElement using <code>innerHTML</code>, then transfer it to the desired target. It'll likely be a bit slower though:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n    function parseSVG(s) {\n        var div= document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml', 'div');\n        div.innerHTML= '&lt;svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"&gt;'+s+'&lt;/svg&gt;';\n        var frag= document.createDocumentFragment();\n        while (div.firstChild.firstChild)\n            frag.appendChild(div.firstChild.firstChild);\n        return frag;\n    }\n\n    document.getElementById('s').appendChild(parseSVG(\n        '&lt;circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"red\" onmousedown=\"alert(\\'hello\\');\"/&gt;'\n    ));\n]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>**: I hate the way the authors of HTML5 seem to be scared of XML and determined to shoehorn XML-based features into the crufty mess that is HTML.

As you know, HTML purposely supports 'tag soup', or the ability to write malformed code and have it corrected into a valid document.  The problem is that the rules for doing this aren't written down anywhere.  When a new browser vendor wants to enter the market, they just have to test malformed documents in various browsers (especially IE) and reverse-engineer their error handling.  If they don't, then many pages won't display correctly (estimates place roughly 90% of pages on the net as being at least somewhat malformed).</p>\n\n<p>So, HTML5 is attempting to discover and codify this error handling, so that browser developers can all standardize and greatly reduce the time and money required to display things consistently.  As well, long in the future after HTML has died as a document format, historians may still want to read our documents, and having a completely defined parsing algorithm will greatly aid this.</p>\n\n<h1>Better Web Application Features</h1>\n\n<p>The secondary goal of HTML5 is to develop the ability of the browser to be an application platform, via HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Many elements have been added directly to the language that are currently (in HTML4) Flash or JS-based hacks, such as <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>.  Useful things such as Local Storage (a js-accessible browser-built-in key-value database, for storing information beyond what cookies can hold), new input types such as date for which the browser can expose easy user interface (so that we don't have to use our js-based calendar date-pickers), and browser-supported form validation will make developing web applications much simpler for the developers, and make them much faster for the users (since many things will be supported natively, rather than hacked in via javascript).</p>\n\n<h1>Improved Element Semantics</h1>\n\n<p>There are many other smaller efforts taking place in HTML5, such as better-defined semantic roles for existing elements (<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> now actually mean something different, and even <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> have vague semantics that should work well when parsing legacy documents) and adding new elements with useful semantics - <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> should replace the majority of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s used on a web page, making your pages a bit more semantic, but more importantly, <em>easier to read</em>.  No more painful scanning to see just what that random <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> is closing - instead you'll have an obvious <code>&lt;/header&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;/article&gt;</code>, making the structure of your document much more intuitive.</p>\n    "},{"t":"html5 - canvas element - Multiple layers","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3008635/html5-canvas-element-multiple-layers","q":"\n\n<p>Without any extension library, is it possible to have multiple layers in the same canvas element?</p>\n\n<p>So if I do a clearRect on the top layer, it will not erase the bottom one?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>No, however, you could layer multiple <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements on top of each other and accomplish something similar.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div style=\"position: relative;\"&gt;\n &lt;canvas id=\"layer1\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" \n   style=\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 0;\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\n &lt;canvas id=\"layer2\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" \n   style=\"position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; z-index: 1;\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Draw your first layer on the <code>layer1</code> canvas, and the second layer on the <code>layer2</code> canvas.

Have anyone of you tried it. Its an incredible tool which claims that developers can use HTML 5 based framework like Sencha touch and Jquery at the same time \nhaving access to native features on phone. Also the code is portable from Android to Iphone with some effort. Before I plunge into it I want to know what is forum's experience with Phonegap. What are the pain points and is it really scalable for enterprise level application development.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>I've built a couple of applications using PhoneGap, and for what it provides, it's great.  There are a couple of quick notes I would like to point out, which might help you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><code>Disable device-based features you're not using</code></strong>\nThe accelerometer, geolocation features are by default turned on.  If you're not using them, I would turn them off, as your app will load faster (initialize) and run smoother.  </p>\n\n<p><strong><code>onDeviceReady</code></strong> - This is the method that's called once phonegap has loaded and is ready.  $(document).ready or whatever you're used to, doesn't really apply here - unless you're only doing interface/hard-coded HTML stuff.  If you're interacting with iPhone features, like GeoLocation, you will need to do everything <strong><em>after</em></strong> onDeviceReady has been called.</p>\n\n<p><strong><code>Pick a UI/library</code></strong>\nThere are a ton of options for the interface/libraries, jquery-mobile, sencha touch, jqtouch, etc.. These each offer a unique approach, and feature-set.  Do some research and use one, but avoid combining.  You can read about some more options, tools here:  <a href=\"http://www.phonegap.com/tool\">http://www.phonegap.com/tool</a> (link updated)</p>\n\n<p><strong><code>Also, more on just mobile development in general, with PhoneGap</code></strong> If you're looking to build apps, that are distributed through the Android market and iPhone App Store, I would read through their exhaustive lists for guidelines on how to develop your app.  For example, in the tools link above, there is a \"tool/plugin\" called <a href=\"http://www.easyapns.com/\">Easy APNS</a> - while this is useful for Android - and technically doable on the iPhone, it violates the development agreement, as it states you must use the Apple notification network, etc..  This is just an example, but reading up on that stuff will save you a lot of headaches, if that's your end goal.  </p>\n\n<p>All in all, it's great for lightweight apps, especially if you come from a web development background.  LocalStorage, GeoLocation, etc.. works really well.  I hope this helps a little...  and feel to ask questions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I really think it comes down to what you want to do, and what you know how to do.  Matt pointed out that developing native apps, for iOS is better, etc..  Yeah, if you have the time and knowledge to learn that - of course native will be better.  But PhoneGap is made for web developers that can take their existing skillset and build apps.  Also, PhoneGap allows you to build apps quickly, for iOS, Android, Symbian, Palm, Blackberry.

The current implementation, using Protovis, is underperformant. Check it out here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.planethunters.org/classify\">http://www.planethunters.org/classify</a></p>\n\n<p>There are about 2000 points when fully zoomed out. Try using the handles on the bottom to zoom in a bit, and drag it to pan around. You will see that it is quite choppy and your CPU usage probably goes up to 100% on one core unless you have a really fast computer. Each change to the focus area calls a redraw to protovis which is pretty darn slow and is worse with more points drawn.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to make some updates to the interface as well as change the underlying visualization technology to be more responsive with animation and interaction. From the following article, it seems like the choice is between another SVG-based library, or a canvas-based one:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-choose-between-canvas-and-svg/\">http://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-choose-between-canvas-and-svg/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">d3.js</a>, which grew out of Protovis, is SVG-based and is <a href=\"http://mbostock.github.com/d3/tutorial/protovis.html\">supposed to be better at rendering animations</a>. However, I'm dubious as to how much better and what its performance ceiling is. For that reason, I'm also considering a more complete overhaul using a canvas-based library like <a href=\"http://www.kineticjs.com/\">KineticJS</a>. However, before I get too far into using one approach or another, I'd like to hear from someone who has done a similar web application with this much data and get their opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing is performance, with a secondary focus on ease of adding other interaction features and programming the animation. There will probably be no more than 2000 points at once, with those small error bars on each one. <strong>Zooming in, out, and panning around need to be smooth.</strong> If the most recent SVG libraries are decent at this, then perhaps the ease of using d3 will outweigh the increased setup for KineticJS, etc. But if there is a huge performance advantage to using a canvas, especially for people with slower computers, then I would definitely prefer to go that way.</p>\n\n<p>Example of app made by the NYTimes that uses SVG, but still animates acceptably smoothly:\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html</a> . If I can get that performance and not have to write my own canvas drawing code, I would probably go for SVG.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that some users have used a hybrid of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12098286/canvas-tooltip-to-appear-outside-canvas\">d3.js manipulation combined with canvas rendering</a>. However, I can't find much documentation about this online or get in contact with the OP of that post. If anyone has any experience doing this kind of DOM-to-Canvas (<a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/1276463\">demo</a>, <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1276463\">code</a>) implementation, I would like to hear from you as well. It seems to be a good hybrid of being able to manipulate data and having custom control over how to render it (and therefore performance), but I'm wondering if having to load everything into the DOM is still going to slow things down.</p>\n\n<p>I know that there are some existing questions that are similar to this one, but none of them exactly ask the same thing. Thanks for your help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: the implementation I ended up using is at <a href=\"https://github.com/zooniverse/LightCurves\">https://github.com/zooniverse/LightCurves</a></p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>Fortunately, drawing 2000 circles is a pretty easy example to test. So here are four possible implementations, two each of Canvas and SVG:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/3680958\">Canvas geometric zooming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/3681006\">Canvas semantic zooming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/3680999\">SVG geometric zooming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bl.ocks.org/3680957\">SVG semantic zooming</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These examples use D3's <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Zoom-Behavior\">zoom behavior</a> to implement zooming and panning. Aside from whether the circles are rendered in Canvas or SVG, the other major distinction is whether you use <em>geometric</em> or <em>semantic</em> zooming.</p>\n\n<p>Geometric zooming means you apply a single transform to the entire viewport: when you zoom in, circles become bigger. Semantic zooming in contrast means you apply transforms to each circle individually: when you zoom in, the circles remain the same size but they spread out. Planethunters.org currently uses semantic zooming, but it might be useful to consider other cases.</p>\n\n<p>Geometric zooming simplifies the implementation: you apply a translate and scale once, and then all the circles are re-rendered. The SVG implementation is particularly simple, updating a single \"transform\" attribute. The performance of both geometric zooming examples feels more than adequate. For semantic zooming, you'll notice that D3 is significantly faster than Protovis. This is because it's doing a lot less work for each zoom event. (The Protovis version has to recalculate all attributes on all elements.) The Canvas-based semantic zooming is a bit more zippy than SVG, but SVG semantic zooming still feels responsive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yet there is no magic bullet for performance, and these four possible approaches don't begin to cover the full space of possibilities.</strong> For example, you could combine geometric and semantic zooming, using the geometric approach for panning (updating the \"transform\" attribute) and only redrawing individual circles while zooming. You could probably even combine one or more of these techniques with CSS3 transforms to add some hardware acceleration (as in the <a href=\"http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html\">hierarchical edge bundling example</a>), although that can be tricky to implement and may introduce visual artifacts.</p>\n\n<p>Still, my personal preference is to <strong>keep as much in SVG as possible, and use Canvas only for the \"inner loop\" when rendering is the bottleneck</strong>. SVG has so many conveniences for development—such as CSS, data-joins and the element inspector—that it is often premature optimization to start with Canvas. Combining Canvas with SVG, as in the Facebook IPO visualization you linked, is a flexible way to retain most of these conveniences while still eking out the best performance. I also used this technique in <a href=\"http://square.github.com/cubism/\">Cubism.js</a>, where the special case of time-series visualization lends itself well to bitmap caching.</p>\n\n<p>As these examples show, you can use D3 with Canvas, even though parts of D3 are SVG-specific.

For everything I've read it appears that every client will maintain an open line of communication with the server. I'm just wondering how that scales and how many open WebSocket connections a server can handle. Maybe leaving those connections open isn't a problem in reality, but it feels like it is.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>In most ways WebSockets will probably scale better than AJAX/HTML requests. However, that doesn't mean WebSockets is a replacement for all uses of AJAX/HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Each TCP connection in itself consumes very little in terms server resources. Often setting up the connection can be expensive but maintaining an idle connection it is almost free. The first limitation that is usually encountered is the maximum number of file descriptors (sockets consume file descriptors) that can be open simultaneously. This often defaults to 1024 but can easily be configured higher.</p>\n\n<p>Ever tried configuring a web server to support tens of thousands of simultaneous AJAX clients? Change those clients into WebSockets clients and it just might be feasible.</p>\n\n<p>HTTP connections, while they don't create open files or consume port numbers for a long period, are more expensive in just about every other way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Each HTTP connection carries a lot of baggage that isn't used most of the time: cookies,  content type, conetent length, user-agent, server id, date, last-modified, etc. Once a WebSockets connection is established, only the data required by the application needs to be sent back and forth.</p></li>\n<li><p>Typically, HTTP servers are configured to log the start and completion of every HTTP request taking up disk and CPU time. It will become standard to log the start and completion of WebSockets data, but while the WebSockets connection doing duplex transfer there won't be any additional logging overhead (except by the application/service if it is designed to do so).</p></li>\n<li><p>Typically, interactive applications that use AJAX either continuously poll or use some sort of long-poll mechanism. WebSockets is a much cleaner (and lower resource) way of doing a more event'd model where the server and client notify each other when they have something to report over the existing connection.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most of the popular web servers in production have a pool of processes (or threads) for handling HTTP requests. As pressure increases the size of the pool will be increased because each process/thread handles one HTTP request at a time. Each additional process/thread uses more memory and creating new processes/threads is quite a bit more expensive than creating new socket connections (which those process/threads still have to do). Most of the popular WebSockets server frameworks are going the event'd route which tends to scale and perform better.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The primary benefit of WebSockets will be lower latency connections for interactive web applications. It will scale better and consume less server resources than HTTP AJAX/long-poll (assuming the application/server is designed properly), but IMO lower latency is the primary benefit of WebSockets because it will enable new classes of web applications that are not possible with the current overhead and latency of AJAX/long-poll.</p>\n\n<p>Once the WebSockets standard becomes more finalized and has broader support, it will make sense to use it for most new interactive web applications that need to communicate frequently with the server. For existing interactive web applications it will really depend on how well the current AJAX/long-poll model is working.

I'm running into a problem wherein large scroll areas cause the elements that are offscreen to appear after a delay when I scroll down to them.</p>\n\n<p>What I mean by that is, if I have a row of images (or even a div with a gradient) that is offscreen, when I scroll down (or up) to it, the <strong>expected behavior</strong> is for the element to appear on screen as I am scrolling to it.</p>\n\n<p>However, what I'm seeing is that the element <strong>does not appear</strong> until I lift my finger off the screen and the scroller finishes all its animations.</p>\n\n<p>This is causing a super noticeable problem for me, making the whole thing look choppy, although it is not. I'm guessing the iPad Safari is trying to do something to save memory. Is there any way in which I can prevent this choppy-ness from happening. Additionally, I would also appreciate if anyone can shed light on what the iPad Safari is actually trying to do.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a ton for all your help, in advance! :-)</p>\n\n<p>Cheers!</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p><strong>This is the complete answer to my question. I had originally marked @Colin Williams' answer as the correct answer, as it helped me get to the complete solution. A community member, @Slipp D. Thompson edited my question, after about 2.5 years of me having asked it, and told me I was abusing SO's Q &amp; A format. He also told me to separately post this as the answer. So here's the complete answer that solved my problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>@Colin Williams, thank you!\nYour answer and the article you linked out to gave me a lead to try something with CSS.</p>\n\n<p>So, I was using translate3d before. It produced unwanted results. Basically, it would chop off and NOT RENDER elements that were offscreen, until I interacted with them. So, basically, in landscape orientation, half of my site that was offscreen was not being shown. This is a iPad web app, owing to which I was in a fix.</p>\n\n<p>Applying translate3d to relatively positioned elements solved the problem for those elements, but other elements stopped rendering, once offscreen. The elements that I couldn't interact with (artwork) would never render again, unless I reloaded the page.</p>\n\n<p>The complete solution:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*:not(html) {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, although this might not be the most \"efficient\" solution, it was the only one that works. Mobile Safari does not render the elements that are offscreen, or sometimes renders erratically, when using <code>-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</code>. Unless a translate3d is applied to all other elements that might go offscreen owing to that scroll, those elements will be chopped off after scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>So, thanks again, and hope this helps some other lost soul. This surely helped me big time!</p>\n    "},{"t":"What is the meaning of polyfills in HTML5?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7087331/what-is-the-meaning-of-polyfills-in-html5","q":"\n\n<p>What is the meaning of polyfills in HTML5?

It defines bunch of markup extensions (mostly as attributes on HTML5 elements), which can be used by the web app developer to provide additional information about the semantics of the various elements to assistive technologies like screen readers. Of course, for ARIA to work, the HTTP user agent that interprets the markup needs to support ARIA, but the spec is created in such a way, as to allow down-level user agents to ignore the ARIA-specific markup safely without affecting the web app's functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example from the ARIA spec:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul role=\"menubar\"&gt;\n\n &lt;!-- Rule 2A: \"File\" label via aria-labelledby --&gt;\n  &lt;li role=\"menuitem\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-labelledby=\"fileLabel\"&gt;&lt;span id=\"fileLabel\"&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;ul role=\"menu\"&gt;\n\n      &lt;!-- Rule 2C: \"New\" label via Namefrom:contents --&gt;\n      &lt;li role=\"menuitem\" aria-haspopup=\"false\"&gt;New&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li role=\"menuitem\" aria-haspopup=\"false\"&gt;Open…&lt;/li&gt;\n      …\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  …\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the <code>role</code> attribute on the outer <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.

This is only run on the initial client connection, so that partial content requests don't try to spawn FFMPEG again.</p>\n\n<pre><code>liveFFMPEG = child_process.spawn(\"ffmpeg\", [\n                \"-i\", \"rtsp://admin:12345@192.168.1.234:554\" , \"-vcodec\", \"copy\", \"-f\",\n                \"mp4\", \"-reset_timestamps\", \"1\", \"-movflags\", \"frag_keyframe+empty_moov\", \n                \"-\"   // output to stdout\n                ],  {detached: false});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2) I use the node http server to capture the STDOUT and stream that back to the client upon a client request. When the client first connects I spawn the above FFMPEG command line then pipe the STDOUT stream to the HTTP response.</p>\n\n<pre><code>liveFFMPEG.stdout.pipe(resp);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also used the stream event to write the FFMPEG data to the HTTP response but makes no difference</p>\n\n<pre><code>xliveFFMPEG.stdout.on(\"data\",function(data) {\n        resp.write(data);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I use the following HTTP header (which is also used and working when streaming pre-recorded files)</p>\n\n<pre><code>var total = 999999999         // fake a large file\nvar partialstart = 0\nvar partialend = total - 1\n\nif (range !== undefined) {\n    var parts = range.replace(/bytes=/, \"\").split(\"-\"); \n    var partialstart = parts[0]; \n    var partialend = parts[1];\n} \n\nvar start = parseInt(partialstart, 10); \nvar end = partialend ? parseInt(partialend, 10) : total;   // fake a large file if no range reques \n\nvar chunksize = (end-start)+1; \n\nresp.writeHead(206, {\n                  'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked'\n                 , 'Content-Type': 'video/mp4'\n                 , 'Content-Length': chunksize // large size to fake a file\n                 , 'Accept-Ranges': 'bytes ' + start + \"-\" + end + \"/\" + total\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3) The client has to use HTML5 video tags.</p>\n\n<p>I have no problems with streaming playback (using fs.createReadStream with 206 HTTP partial content) to the HTML5 client a video file previously recorded with the above FFMPEG command line (but saved to a file instead of STDOUT), so I know the FFMPEG stream is correct, and I can even correctly see the video live streaming in VLC when connecting to the HTTP node server.</p>\n\n<p>However trying to stream live from FFMPEG via node HTTP seems to be a lot harder as the client will display one frame then stop. I suspect the problem is that I am not setting up the HTTP connection to be compatible with the HTML5 video client. I have tried a variety of things like using HTTP 206 (partial content) and 200 responses, putting the data into a buffer then streaming with no luck, so I need to go back to first principles to ensure I'm setting this up the right way.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my understanding of how this should work, please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>\n\n<p>1) FFMPEG should be setup to fragment the output and use an empty moov (FFMPEG frag_keyframe and empty_moov mov flags). This means the client does not use the moov atom which is typically at the end of the file which isn't relevant when streaming (no end of file), but means no seeking possible which is fine for my use case.</p>\n\n<p>2) Even though I use MP4 fragments and empty MOOV, I still have to use HTTP partial content, as the HTML5 player will wait until the entire stream is downloaded before playing, which with a live stream never ends so is unworkable.</p>\n\n<p>3) I don't understand why piping the STDOUT stream to the HTTP response doesn't work when streaming live yet if I save to a file I can stream this file easily to HTML5 clients using similar code. Maybe it's a timing issue as it takes a second for the FFMPEG spawn to start, connect to the IP camera and send chunks to node, and the node data events are irregular as well. However the bytestream should be exactly the same as saving to a file, and HTTP should be able to cater for delays.</p>\n\n<p>4) When checking the network log from the HTTP client when streaming a MP4 file created by FFMPEG from the camera, I see there are 3 client requests: A general GET request for the video, which the HTTP server returns about 40Kb, then a partial content request with a byte range for the last 10K of the file, then a final request for the bits in the middle not loaded. Maybe the HTML5 client once it receives the first response is asking for the last part of the file to load the MP4 MOOV atom? If this is the case it won't work for streaming as there is no MOOV file and no end of the file.</p>\n\n<p>5) When checking the network log when trying to stream live, I get an aborted initial request with only about 200 bytes received, then a re-request again aborted with 200 bytes and a third request which is only 2K long. I don't understand why the HTML5 client would abort the request as the bytestream is exactly the same as I can successfully use when streaming from a recorded file. It also seems node isn't sending the rest of the FFMPEG stream to the client, yet I can see the FFMPEG data in the .on event routine so it is getting to the FFMPEG node HTTP server.</p>\n\n<p>6) Although I think piping the STDOUT stream to the HTTP response buffer should work, do I have to build an intermediate buffer and stream that will allow the HTTP partial content client requests to properly work like it does when it (successfully) reads a file? I think this is the main reason for my problems however I'm not exactly sure in Node how to best set that up. And I don't know how to handle a client request for the data at the end of the file as there is no end of file.</p>\n\n<p>7) Am I on the wrong track with trying to handle 206 partial content requests, and should this work with normal 200 HTTP responses? HTTP 200 responses works fine for VLC so I suspect the HTML5 video client will only work with partial content requests?</p>\n\n<p>As I'm still learning this stuff its difficult to work through the various layers of this problem (FFMPEG, node, streaming, HTTP, HTML5 video) so any pointers will be greatly appreciated. I have spent hours researching on this site and the net, and I have not come across anyone who has been able to do real time streaming in node but I can't be the first, and I think this should be able to work (somehow!).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>There are many reasons why video and, specifically, live video is very difficult.

Yes, they are both video, but the problems are different, hence the formats are different. For example, if the clock in your computer runs 1% faster than it should, you will not notice on a VOD. With live video, you will be trying to play video before it happens. If you want to join a a live video stream in progress, you need the data necessary to initialize the decoder, so it must be repeated in the stream, or sent out of band. With VOD, you can read the beginning of the file them seek to whatever point you wish.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's dig in a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Platforms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS</li>\n<li>PC</li>\n<li>Mac</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Codecs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>vp8/9</li>\n<li>h.264</li>\n<li>thora (vp3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Common Delivery methods for live video in browsers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DASH (HTTP)</li>\n<li>HLS (HTTP)</li>\n<li>flash (RTMP)</li>\n<li>flash (HDS)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Common Delivery methods for VOD in browsers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DASH (HTTP Streaming)</li>\n<li>HLS (HTTP Streaming)</li>\n<li>flash (RTMP)</li>\n<li>flash (HTTP Streaming)</li>\n<li>MP4 (HTTP pseudo streaming)</li>\n<li>I'm not going to talk about MKV and OOG because I do not know them very well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>html5 video tag:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MP4</li>\n<li>webm</li>\n<li>ogg</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Lets look at which browsers support what formats</p>\n\n<p>Safari:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HLS (iOS and mac only)</li>\n<li>h.264</li>\n<li>MP4</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Firefox</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DASH (via MSE but no h.264)</li>\n<li>h.264 via Flash only!</li>\n<li>VP9</li>\n<li>MP4</li>\n<li>OGG</li>\n<li>Webm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>IE</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flash</li>\n<li>DASH (via MSE IE 11+ only)</li>\n<li>h.264</li>\n<li>MP4</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Chrome</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flash</li>\n<li>DASH (via MSE)</li>\n<li>h.264</li>\n<li>VP9</li>\n<li>MP4</li>\n<li>webm</li>\n<li>ogg</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>MP4 cannot be used for live video (NOTE: DASH is a superset of MP4, so don't get confused with that). MP4 is broken into two pieces: moov and mdat. mdat contains the raw audio video data. But it is not indexed, so without the moov, it is useless. The moov contains an index of all data in the mdat. But due to its format, it can not be 'flattened' until the timestamps and size of EVERY frame is known. It may be possible to construct an moov that 'fibs' the frame sizes, but is is very wasteful bandwidth wise. </p>\n\n<p>So if you want to deliver everywhere, we need to find the least common denominator. You will see there is no LCD here without resorting to flash\nexample:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iOS only supports h.264 video. and it only supports HLS for live.</li>\n<li>Firefox does not support h.264 at all, unless you use flash</li>\n<li>Flash does not work in iOS</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The closest thing to an LCD is using HLS to get your iOS users, and flash for everyone else.\nMy personal favorite is to encode HLS, then use flash to play HLS for everyone else. You can play HLS in flash via JW player 6, (or write your own HLS to FLV in AS3 like I did)</p>\n\n<p>Soon, the most common way to do this will be HLS on iOS/Mac and DASH via MSE everywhere else (This is what Netflix will be doing soon). But we are still waiting for everyone to upgrade their browsers. You will also likely need a separate DASH/VP9 for Firefox (I know about open264; it sucks. It can't do video in main or high profile.

Any requirement to store data on an ongoing basis across sessions will need to involve your application server side - most likely using a database, but possibly XML or a text/CSV file.</p>\n\n<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all client storage solutions. Session data is held on the server where it remains under your direct control.</p>\n\n<h1>localStorage and sessionStorage</h1>\n\n<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name persists) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the window is closed) - it does however survive page reloads (source <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage\">DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Network</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case.</p>\n\n<p>localStorage and sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data needed within client scripts between pages (for example: preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of sensitive or security related data within applications. </p>\n\n<h1>Cookies</h1>\n\n<p>This is also true for cookies, these can be trivially tampered with by the user, and data can also be read from them in plain text - so if you are wanting to store sensitive data then session is really your only option. If you are not using SSL, cookie information can also be intercepted in transit, especially on an open wifi.</p>\n\n<p>On the positive side cookies can have a degree of protection applied from security risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)/Script injection by setting an HTTP only flag which means modern (supporting) browsers will prevent access to the cookies and values from JavaScript (this will also prevent your own, legitimate, JavaScript from accessing them). This is especially important with authentication cookies, which are used to store a token containing details of the user who is logged on - if you have a copy of that cookie then for all intents and purposes you <em>become</em> that user as far as the web application is concerned, and have the same access to data and functionality the user has.</p>\n\n<p>As cookies are used for authentication purposes and persistence of user data, <strong>all</strong> cookies valid for a page are sent from the browser to the server for <strong>every</strong> request to the same domain - this includes the original page request, any subsequent Ajax requests, all images, stylesheets, scripts and fonts. For this reason cookies should not be used to store large amounts of information. Browser may also impose limits on the size of information that can be stored in cookies. Typically cookies are used to store identifying tokens for authentication, session and advertising tracking. The tokens are typically not human readable information in and of themselves, but encrypted identifiers linked to your application or database.</p>\n\n<h1>localStorage vs. sessionStorage vs. Cookies</h1>\n\n<p>In terms of capabilities, cookies only allow you to store strings. sessionStorage and localStorage allow you to store JavaScript primitives but not Objects or Arrays (it is possible to JSON serialise them to store them using the APIs). Session storage will generally allow you to store any primitives or objects supported by your Server Side language/framework.</p>\n\n<h1>Client-side vs. Server-side</h1>\n\n<p>As HTTP is a stateless protocol - web applications have no way of identifying a user from previous visits on returning to the web site - session data usually relies on a cookie token to identify the user for repeat visits (although rarely URL parameters may be used for the same purpose). Data will usually have a sliding expiry time (renewed each time the user visits), and depending on your server/framework data will either be stored in-process (meaning data will be lost if the web server crashes or is restarted) or externally in a state server or database. This is also necessary when using a web-farm (more than one server for a given website).</p>\n\n<p>As session data is completely controlled by your application (server side) it is the best place for anything sensitive or secure in nature.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious disadvantage with server side data is scalability - server resources are required for each user for the duration of the session, and that any data needed client side must be sent with each request. As the server has no way of knowing if a user navigates to another site or closes their browser, session data must expire after a given time to avoid all server resources being taken up by abandoned sessions. When using session data you should therefore be aware of the possibility that data will have expired and been lost, especially on pages with long forms. It will also be lost if the user deletes their cookies or switches browsers/devices.</p>\n\n<p>Some web frameworks/developers use hidden HTML inputs to persist data from one page of a form to another to avoid session expiration.</p>\n\n<p>localStorage, sessionStorage and cookies are all subject to \"same-origin\" rules which means browsers should prevent access to the data except from the domain that set the information to start with.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading on client storage technologies see <a href=\"http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html\">Dive Into Html 5</a>.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Section vs Article HTML5","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7549561/section-vs-article-html5","q":"\n\n<p>I have a page made up of various \"sections\" like videos, a newsfeed etc..

The idea being I have people working in remote areas without any cellular data connection and they need to run queries on this data and edit it while offline. Partly it will be geo-location based so if there are assets in the area they are in (uses GPS) then it will show those assets and let them be edited. When they return to the office they can sync the data back to the office server.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that I'm approaching this from a web standard point of view is basically to save money and time by writing it once in HTML5 and then it works across multiple platforms rather than writing it twice in Objective C and Java. Also if you write something that's platform agnostic then you're not locked in and don't go down with the ship when everyone moves to a newer one.

IndexedDB and local storage are unusable at present.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how Mozilla and Microsoft got the Web SQL Database standard deprecated and why the W3C let it happen. Supposedly between them they have 77% of the desktop browser market. On advanced mobile devices Mozilla and Microsoft have nearly zero influence as <a href=\"http://www.netmarketshare.com/\">Safari, Opera and Android have over 90% of the market share</a>. How Mozilla &amp; Microsoft can dictate which standard should be used in the mobile market which is where offline storage is most likely to be used doesn't make any sense.</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-and-the-road-to-indexeddb/\">comments from Mozilla</a> about why they wanted to go with IndexedDB instead are mainly about 'developer aesthetics' and they don't like the idea of running SQL in JavaScript. I'm not buying it.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Currently the proposed standard is inferior and an extremely basic NoSQL implementation that is slow and doesn't even support the advanced features people need in a database. There is a lot of boilerplate code to establish the database and get data out but they claim people will write some nice abstraction libraries over the top of it that will provide more advanced features. As of Oct 2011 they're nowhere to be seen.</p></li>\n<li><p>They've deprecated the existing Web SQL standard which actually works and is implemented in the main mobile/tablet browsers. Whereas their 'new' and 'better' standard is not available in the major mobile browsers.</p></li>\n<li><p>What are we as developers supposed to use for the next 3-5 years which is when the IndexedDB specification might get around to being standardised, have more features, implemented in the main mobile/tablet browsers and there's some nice libraries to make things easier?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The W3C should keep the Web SQL Database standard running in parallel and just fix the issues. It already has support for the major mobile platforms and it works pretty well. The fact that Mozilla and Microsoft as the two players with the most desktop browser share were able to get this standard scrapped is pretty dubious and could be seen as an attempt to hinder progress on the mobile web platforms until they are able to catch up and offer competing solutions against iOS/Safari and Android.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion does anyone have a solution for my problem that will work for iOS/Android for phone/tablet devices. Maybe a nice wrapper API that can use multiple database implementations in the background with querying capability and it lets you choose which database has priority. I've seen things like <a href=\"http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/\">lawnchair</a> but I'm pretty sure it only lets you use local storage by default and falls back to the to the others.

The issue here is downsampling.<br>\nTo downsample an image, we need to turn each square of p * p pixels in the original image into a single pixel in the destination image.<br>\nFor performances reasons Browsers do a very simple downsampling : to build the smaller image, they will just pick ONE pixel in the source and use its value for the destination. which 'forgots' some details and adds noise.<br>\nYet there's an exception to that : since the 2X image downsampling is very simple to compute (average 4 pixels to make one) and is used for retina/HiDPI pixels, this case is handled properly -the Browser does make use of 4 pixels to make one-.<br>\nBUT... if you use several time a 2X downsampling, you'll face the issue that the successive rounding errors will add too much noise.<br>\nWhat's worse, you won't always resize by a power of two, and resizing to the nearest power + a last resizing is very noisy.</p>\n\n<p>What you seek is a pixel-perfect downsampling, that is : a re-sampling of the image that will take all input pixels into account -whatever the scale-.<br>\nTo do that we must compute, for each input pixel, its contribution to one, two, or four destination pixels depending wether the scaled projection of the input pixels is right inside a destination pixels, overlaps an X border, an Y border, or both.<br>\n( A scheme would be nice here, but i don't have one. )  </p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of canvas scale vs my pixel perfect scale on a 1/3 scale of a zombat.\nNotice that the picture might get scaled in your Browser, and is .jpegized by S.O..<br>\nYet we see that there's much less noise especially in the grass behind the wombat, and the branches on its right. The noise in the fur makes it more contrasted, but it looks like he's got white hairs -unlike source picture-.<br>\nRight image is less catchy but definitively nicer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jwqOI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Here's the code to do the pixel perfect downscaling :</p>\n\n<p>fiddle result : \n<a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/gamealchemist/r6aVp/embedded/result/\">http://jsfiddle.net/gamealchemist/r6aVp/embedded/result/</a><br>\nfiddle itself : <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/gamealchemist/r6aVp/\">http://jsfiddle.net/gamealchemist/r6aVp/</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>// scales the image by (float) scale &lt;

Does anyone know the solution?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p><strong>Update September 2014: iOS 8 has removed the <code>minimal-ui</code> feature</strong>\nThere's again no way to remove/hide navigation bars other than to rely on the default browser behavior (bars will be hidden when scrolling, but only if the scrolling element is the <code>BODY</code> of the page). The only \"workaround\" is to save the app to the homescreen and have the proper meta tags set (see below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update August 2014: iOS 8 (beta) no longer supports <code>minimal-ui</code></strong>.\nThere's no workaround. (The reason for this is likely due to abuse by websites that used it to try to prevent people from navigating away, tho there may be new features in iOS 8 Safari that have not been made public yet that replace <code>minimal-ui</code>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>iOS 7.1 added a new API to solve this problem:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"minimal-ui\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This new viewport flag hides the Safari UI by default (only a small title bar with URL and SSL indicator are shown). To access the Safari UI, users must actively tap this title bar.</p>\n\n<p>Note that <strong>on iOS 7.0.x, there's no API or known workaround</strong> for this. In those versions, if you want to hide Safari's browser chrome permanently you need to either get the user to add the web app to the home screen (with the appropriate meta tags set <code>&lt;meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"&gt;</code>) or use some sort of native app wrapper like Phonegap and distribute via the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I wish they hadn't removed the \"full screen\" button they introduced in landscape mode on iOS 6 Mobile Safari, which was a great solution that made developers and users happy.</p>\n\n<p>A perfect candidate for this to be solved more permanently would be for Mobile Safari to support the HTML5 full screen API (which is supported on Safari on OS X!).

Currently, an <code>&lt;input type=\"date\"&gt;</code>field just opens the standard soft keyboard on Android and iOS. I suppose that in the future the mobile OS's soft keyboards will include date pickers and such - just as <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> invokes the native select today.</p>\n\n<p>Since this isn't implemented on either Android or iOS, but is implemented in native UI, is it possible for a web-app to invoke the native date picker, i.e. when clicked on?</p>\n\n<p>This would make it possible for us to stop using JavaScript libraries like jQuery mobile and YUI.</p>\n\n<p>If my question is in any way unclear, please tell me. Thank you in advance :-)</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>Since some years some devices support <code>&lt;input type=\"date\"&gt;</code> but others don't, so one needs to be careful. Here are some observations from 2012, which still might be valid today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One can detect if <code>type=\"date\"</code> is supported by setting that attribute and then reading back its value. Browsers/devices that don't support it will ignore setting the type to <code>date</code> and return <code>text</code> when reading back that attribute. Alternatively, <a href=\"http://modernizr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modernizr</a> can be used for detection. Beware that it's not enough to check for some Android version; like the Samsung Galaxy S2 on Android 4.0.3 does support <code>type=\"date\"</code>, but the Google/Samsung Nexus S on the more recent Android 4.0.4 does <em>not</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>When presetting the date for the native date picker, be sure to use a format the device recognizes. When not doing that, devices might silently reject it, leaving one with an empty input field when trying to show an existing value. Like using the date picker on a Galaxy S2 running Android 4.0.3 might itself set the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> to <code>2012-6-1</code> for June 1st. However, when setting the value from JavaScript, it needs leading zeroes: <code>2012-06-01</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>When using things like Cordova (PhoneGap) to display the native date picker on devices that don't support <code>type=\"date\"</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Be sure to properly detect built-in support. Like in 2012 on the Galaxy S2 running Android 4.0.3, erroneously <em>also</em> using the Cordova Android plugin would result in showing the date picker twice in a row: once again after clicking \"set\" in its first occurrence. </p></li>\n<li><p>When there's multiple inputs on the same page, some devices show \"previous\" and \"next\" to get into another form field. On iOS 4, this does not trigger the <code>onclick</code> handler and hence gives the user a regular input. Using <code>onfocus</code> to trigger the plugin seemed to work better.</p></li>\n<li><p>On iOS 4, using <code>onclick</code> or <code>onfocus</code> to trigger the 2012 iOS plugin first made the regular keyboard show, after which the date picker was placed on top of that. Next, after using the date picker, one still needed to close the regular keyboard. Using <code>$(this).blur()</code> to remove focus before the date picker was shown helped for iOS 4 and did not affect other devices I tested. But it introduced some quick flashing of the keyboard on iOS, and things could be even more confusing on first usage as then the date picker was slower. One could fully disable the regular keyboard by making the input <code>readonly</code> if one were using the plugin, but that disabled the \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons when typing in other inputs on the same screen. It also seems the iOS 4 plugin did not make the native date picker show \"cancel\" or \"clear\", but <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UIDatePicker_Class/Reference/UIDatePicker.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">I guess that's an iOS 4 thing</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>On an iOS 4 iPad (simulator), in 2012 the Cordova plugin did not seem to render correctly, basically not giving the user any option to enter or change a date. <em>(Maybe iOS 4 doesn't render its native date picker nicely on top of a web view, or maybe my web view's CSS styling has some effect, and surely this might be different on a real device: please comment or edit!)</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Though, again in 2012, the Android date picker plugin tried to use the same JavaScript API as the iOS plugin, and its example used <code>allowOldDates</code>, the Android version actually did not support that. Also, it returned the new date as <code>2012/7/2</code> while the iOS version returned <code>Mon Jul 02 2012 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (CEST)</code>.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Even when <code>&lt;input type=\"date\"&gt;</code> is supported, things might look messy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>iOS 5 nicely displays <code>2012-06-01</code> in a localized format, like <code>1 Jun. 2012</code> or <code>June 1, 2012</code> (and even updates that immediately while still operating the date picker). However, the Galaxy S2 running Android 4.0.3 shows the ugly <code>2012-6-1</code> or <code>2012-06-01</code>, no matter which locale is used.</p></li>\n<li><p>iOS 5 on an iPad (simulator) does not hide the keyboard when that is already visible when touching the date input, or when using \"previous\" or \"next\" in another input. It then simultaneously shows the date picker below the input <em>and</em> the keyboard at the bottom, and <em>seems</em> to allow any input from both. However, though it does change the visible value, the keyboard input is actually ignored. (Shown when reading back the value, or when invoking the date picker again.) When the keyboard was not yet shown, then touching the date input only shows the date picker, not the keyboard. <em>(This might be different on a real device, please comment or edit!)</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Devices might show a cursor in the input field, and a long press might trigger the clipboard options, possibly showing the regular keyboard too. When clicking, some devices might even show the regular keyboard for a split second, before changing to show the date picker.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n    "},{"t":"Why does the Google homepage use deprecated HTML (ie. is not valid HTML5)?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1038191/why-does-the-google-homepage-use-deprecated-html-ie-is-not-valid-html5","q":"\n\n<p>I was looking at the <code>www.google.com</code> in Firebug and noticed something odd: The Google logo is centered using a center tag.</p>\n\n<p>So I went and checked the page with the <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://www.google.com/&amp;charset=%28detect+automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0\">W3C validator</a> and it found 48 errors.

Rather, they're a <strong>not-changing-the-rules</strong> thing. </p>\n\n<p>Preflight requests have nothing to do with security, and they have no bearing on applications that are being developed now, with an awareness of CORS. Rather, the preflight mechanism benefits servers that were developed <em>without</em> an awareness of CORS, and it functions as a sanity check between the client and the server that they are both CORS-aware. The developers of CORS felt that there were enough servers out there that were relying on the assumption that they would never receive, e.g. a cross-domain DELETE request that they invented the preflight mechanism to allow both sides to opt-in. They felt that the alternative, which would have been to simply enable the cross-domain calls, would have broken too many existing applications.</p>\n\n<p>There are three scenarios here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Old servers, no longer under development, and developed before CORS. These servers may make assumptions that they'll never receive e.g. a cross-domain DELETE request. <strong>This scenario is the primary beneficiary of the preflight mechanism.</strong> Yes these services could already be abused by a malicious or non-conforming user agent (and CORS does nothing to change this), but in a world with CORS the preflight mechanism provides an extra 'sanity check' so that clients and servers don't break because the underlying rules of the web have changed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Servers that are still under development, but which contain a lot of old code and for which it's not feasible/desirable to audit all the old code to make sure it works properly in a cross-domain world. This scenario allows servers to progressively opt-in to CORS, e.g. by saying \"Now I'll allow this particular header\", \"Now I'll allow this particular HTTP verb\", \"Now I'll allow cookies/auth information to be sent\", etc. <strong>This scenario benefits from the preflight mechanism.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>New servers that are written with an awareness of CORS. According to standard security practices, the server has to protect its resources in the face of <em>any</em> incoming request -- servers can't trust clients to not do malicious things. <strong>This scenario doesn't benefit from the preflight mechanism</strong>: the preflight mechanism brings no additional security to a server that has properly protected its resources.</p></li>\n</ol>\n    "},{"t":"How to properly use h1 in HTML5","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7405282/how-to-properly-use-h1-in-html5","q":"\n\n<p>Which of the following is the correct way to structure a page:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) <code>h1</code> only in <code>header</code></strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Site title&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;\n&lt;/header&gt;\n&lt;section&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Page title&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I use <code>h1</code> exclusively inside <code>header</code> as the site's title, every page will have the same content for the <code>h1</code> tag.

The key is to use the <strong>box-sizing: border-box</strong> property so when you specify the width that <em>includes</em> the border and padding.

How are HTML 4, and as far as I know, HTML 5 do not support namespaces. Also HTML 5 has some new elements that are not available in XHTML. Even HTML 4 and XHTML have some differences regarding elements and attributes they support.</p>\n\n<p>The question is: Is it possible to render HTML 4/5 documents using Facelets? If so, how?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>Since Facelets is a XML based view technology which eats and emits in essence XML markup, you cannot use it with a HTML4 doctype. The HTML4 doctype describes several elements which cannot be self-closing, like <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>. However, with XML you're forced to close them like <code>&lt;link/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta/&gt;</code>, etc. So using a HTML4 doctype is absolutely not an option for Facelets (that is, when you respect the standards and/or fear the w3 validator, it will however work perfectly on the most if not all webbrowsers).</p>\n\n<p>HTML5, on the other hand, allows XML markup. This is specified in <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#elements\" rel=\"nofollow\">chapter 3.2.2 - Elements</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;link type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Authors may optionally choose to use this same syntax for void elements in the HTML syntax as well. Some authors also choose to include whitespace before the slash, however this is not necessary. (Using whitespace in that fashion is a convention inherited from the compatibility guidelines in XHTML 1.0, Appendix C.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I myself use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> all the way, also with JSF/Facelets, even without a <code>&lt;?xml?&gt;</code> declaration in top of the page. It works perfectly in all browsers. With a XHTML doctype you should as per the specification be using a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> which would only make MSIE to choke (it doesn't understand it). And since that's still one of the most widely used browsers... Replacing the XHTML content type by <code>text/html</code> is <a href=\"http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">considered harmful</a>, you also don't want to do this.</p>\n\n<p>As per your arguments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>HTML 5 do not support namespaces.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn't matter. The namespaces are only of interest for the XML based server side view technology (like as Facelets) which in turn can generate pure HTML with those tags. The following example is legitimately valid for Facelets:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"\n    xmlns:f=\"http://java.sun.com/jsf/core\" \n    xmlns:h=\"http://java.sun.com/jsf/html\"&gt;\n    &lt;h:head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/h:head&gt;\n    &lt;h:body&gt;\n        &lt;h:outputText value=\"#{bean.text}\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/h:body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This renders legitimately valid HTML5 (for the client side):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        Some text\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You see, Facelets already removes the XHTML declarations since they have no meaning in the client side.</p>\n\n<p>And,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Also HTML 5 has some new elements that are not available in XHTML</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this make also no sense. It's all about the generated output. Which can be HTML5 as good. Your only problem may be the browser support and the availability of 3rd party JSF components which renders HTML5 specific elements.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, XHTML is overhyped. Its sole intent is to ease HTML development using <strong>XML based tools</strong> which can manipulate/transform/generate HTML pages on the server side (like as Facelets). But some starters also use it without using any XML tool and output it plain as-is, because it's \"so cool\" -for some unclear reason. </p>\n\n<p>Don't get me wrong.

Their goals are largely the same:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fast, robust, modern Web development </li>\n<li>HTML5 (duh!)</li>\n<li>Cross-browser normalization (including support for IE6 and mobile browsers)</li>\n<li>Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation</li>\n<li>Performance optimizations</li>\n<li>Not a framework, but the starting point for your next project</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously, they're very similar in function. In what ways are their implementations different (for example, perhaps IE-specific CSS fixes are achieved using different techniques)? Are they at all different in scope? It seems like HTML5 Boilerplate is a bit larger (build tools, server configuration, etc.), but it's hard to know where it goes beyond HTML5 Reset when it comes to the actual site that people will see.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>In general, both projects set out to provide a solid starting point for developers working on web projects. They both get rid of a lot of the tedious, some-what error-prone boilerplate that many developers find themselves re-creating for each project. The details in how they go about it are slightly different, but for the most part, they achieve the same results.</p>\n\n<p>HTML5Boilerplate has, as you noted, added in some build-script pieces to help developers follow best practices to speed up their pages in terms of server-side items, such as far-future expires headers, etc. where-as the HTML5Reset project is more focused on the semantics, content, and styling. For example, HTML5Reset has more example structure for the content of the page in HTML5 (to help show people how to use some of the new elements), whereas HTML5Boilerplate does not.</p>\n\n<p>The response-time and page speed parts that HTML5Boilerplate includes get more and more important as more users find themselves on mobile platforms, and as Google increases the effect <a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html\">page response times have on page rank</a>.

The IE specific fixes, however, are largely the same, with HTML5Boilerplate asserting a bit more control than HTML5Reset over how IE styles some things like form elements (ie. check box / radio buttons and valid / invalid states)</p>\n\n<p>Two major CSS areas that HTML5Boilerplate covers that HTML5Reset does not are common helper classes to assist with making sites more accessible, such as <code>.hidden</code> and <code>.visuallyhidden</code>, as well as some substantial adjustments to the print styles that serve to both make printing more similar across browsers, as well as some cost-savings and accessibility things like making background images transparent (to not waste toner), and adding the actual URL to links and the title to abbreviations.</p>\n\n<p>I would highly suggest reading through both projects' info and how they do things in a side-by-side comparison because the similarities, and also the differences (and the reasoning behind them) is quite informative and has helped me to better decide what parts of each I wanted to use.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, just like any \"library\" sort of project, you as the developer need to understand what you are doing and probably should tweak your baseline to meet the particular needs of the project.</p>\n    "},{"t":"How does inline Javascript (in HTML) work?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10607847/how-does-inline-javascript-in-html-work","q":"\n\n<p>I know this is bad practice.

It is just not enough to dynamically add new content to <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> page, new content must be enhanced with classic <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> styling. Because this is rather processing heavy task there need to be some priorities, if possible <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> needs to do as less enhancing as possible. Don't enhance whole page if only one component need's to be styled.</p>\n\n<p>What does this all means? When page plugin dispatches a <strong>pageInit</strong> event, which most widgets use to auto-initialize themselves. it will automatically enhance any instances of the widgets it finds on the page.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you generate new markup client-side or load in content via Ajax and inject it into a page, you can trigger the create event to handle the auto-initialization for all the plugins contained within the new markup. This can be triggered on any element (even the page div itself), saving you the task of manually initializing each plugin (listview button, select, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind lets discuss enhancement levels. There are three of them and they are sorted from the less resource demanding to higher ones:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Enhance a single component/widget</li>\n<li>Enhance a page content</li>\n<li>Enhance a full page content (header, content, footer)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Enhance a single component/widget:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Important:</strong> The below enhancement methods are to be used only on current/active page. For dynamically inserted pages, those pages and their contents will be enhanced once inserted into DOM. Calling any method on dynamically created pages / other than the active page, will result an error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> widget can be enhanced dynamically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/\"><strong>Listview</strong></a> :</p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#mylist').listview('refresh');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Removing listview elements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#mylist li').eq(0).addClass('ui-screen-hidden'); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/LrAyE/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/LrAyE/</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Note that the refresh() method only affects new nodes appended to a list. This is done for performance reasons.</em></p>\n\n<p>One of a listview high-points is a filtering functionality. Unfortunately, for some reason, jQuery Mobile will fail to dynamically add filter option to an existing listview. Fortunately there's a workaround. If possible, remove current listview and add another one with a filer option turned on.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a working example: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/15163984/1848600\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/15163984/1848600</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).on('pagebeforeshow', '#index', function(){       \n    $('&lt;ul&gt;').attr({'id':'test-listview','data-role':'listview', 'data-filter':'true','data-filter-placeholder':'Search...'}).appendTo('#index [data-role=\"content\"]');\n    $('&lt;li&gt;').append('&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;').appendTo('#test-listview');\n    $('&lt;li&gt;').append('&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;').appendTo('#test-listview');\n    $('&lt;li&gt;').append('&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Opel&lt;/a&gt;').appendTo('#test-listview');\n    $('#test-listview').listview().listview('refresh');\n});\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/\"><strong>Button</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[type=\"button\"]').button();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/m4rjZ/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/m4rjZ/</a></p>\n\n<p>One more thing, you don't need to use a input element to create a button, it can be even done with a basic div, here's an example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/L9xcN/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/L9xcN/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/navbar/\"><strong>Navbar</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[data-role=\"navbar\"]').navbar();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/w4m2B/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/w4m2B/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here's a demo how to add dynamic navbar tab: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/V6nHp/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/V6nHp/</a></p>\n\n<p>And one more in <strong>pagebeforecreate</strong> event: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/SJG8W/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/SJG8W/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/\"><strong>Text inputs, Search inputs &amp; Textareas</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[type=\"text\"]').textinput();   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/9UQ9k/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/9UQ9k/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/slider/\"><strong>Sliders &amp; Flip toggle switch</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[type=\"range\"]').slider();  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/caCsf/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/caCsf/</a></p>\n\n<p>Enhancement example during the pagebeforecreate event: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/NwMLP/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/NwMLP/</a></p>\n\n<p>Sliders are little bit buggy to dynamically create, read more about it here: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/15708562/1848600\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/15708562/1848600</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/controlgroup/\"><strong>Checkbox &amp; Radiobox</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('[type=\"radio\"]').checkboxradio();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or if you want to select/deselect another Radiobox/Checkbox element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\"input[type='radio']\").eq(0).attr(\"checked\",false).checkboxradio(\"refresh\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\"input[type='radio']\").eq(0).attr(\"checked\",true).checkboxradio(\"refresh\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/VAG6F/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/VAG6F/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/select/\"><strong>Select menu</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('select').selectmenu();  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/dEXac/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/dEXac/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/\"><strong>Collapsible</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately collapsible element can't be enhanced through some specific method, so trigger('create') must be used instead.</p>\n\n<p>Enhancement example: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/ck6uK/\">http://jsfiddle.net/Gajotres/ck6uK/</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-reflow/\"><strong>Table</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Markup enhancement: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\".selector\").table(\"refresh\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While this is a standard way of table enhancement, at this point I can't make it work.

They mention the HTML 5 spec for Favicon: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The current HTML5 specification recommends specifying size icons in multiple sizes using the attributes rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"space-separated list of icon dimensions\" within a  tag. [<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/links.html#rel-icon\">source</a>] Multiple icon formats, including container formats such as Microsoft .ico and Macintosh .icns files, as well as Scalable Vector Graphics may be provided by including the icon's content type in the form of type=\"file content-type\" within the  tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looking at the cited article (W3) they show this example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=icon href=favicon.png sizes=\"16x16\" type=\"image/png\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=icon href=windows.ico sizes=\"32x32 48x48\" type=\"image/vnd.microsoft.icon\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=icon href=mac.icns sizes=\"128x128 512x512 8192x8192 32768x32768\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=icon href=iphone.png sizes=\"57x57\" type=\"image/png\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=icon href=gnome.svg sizes=\"any\" type=\"image/svg+xml\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My question is do any browsers support the HTML 5 method? </p>\n\n<p>Note: I know Apple uses their <code>apple-touch-icon</code> meta tag method over the HTML5 method.</p>\n\n<p>The wikipedia article claims:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Google Chrome web browser however, will select the closest matching size from those provided in the HTML headers to create 128×128 pixel application icons when the user chooses the Create application shortcuts... from the \"Tools\" menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does Internet Explorer (v9 to v11) and Firefox handle this? And is the article correct in how Chrome handles the HTML Favicons? (There is no source cited for Chrome confirming this.) </p>\n\n<p>In searching I wasn't able to really find any (credible) info on HTML 5 Favicon other than the Wikipedia Article.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>The answers provided (at the time of this post) are link only answers so I thought I would summarize the links into an answer and what I will be using.</p>\n\n<p>When working to create Cross Browser Favicons (including touch icons) there are several things to consider. </p>\n\n<p>The first (of course) is Internet Explorer. IE does not support PNG favicons until version 11. So our first line is a conditional comment for favicons in IE 9 and below: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"path/to/favicon.ico\"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To cover the uses of the icon create it at 32x32 pixels. Notice the <code>rel=\"shortcut icon\"</code> for IE to recognize the icon it needs the word <code>shortcut</code> which is not standard. Also we wrap the <code>.ico</code> favicon in a IE conditional comment because Chrome and Safari will use the <code>.ico</code> file if it is present, despite other options available, not what we would like. </p>\n\n<p>The above covers IE up to IE 9. IE 11 accepts PNG favicons, however, IE 10 does not. Also IE 10 does not read conditional comments thus IE 10 won't show a favicon. With IE 11 out IE 10 will continue to fall in use quickly.</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of the browsers we are going to use the standard way to cite a favicon: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"path/to/favicon.png\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This icon should be 196x196 pixels in size to cover all devices that may use this icon.</p>\n\n<p>To cover touch icons on mobile devices we are going to use Apple's proprietary way to cite a touch icon: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using <code>rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\"</code> will not apply the reflective shine when bookmarked on iOS. To have iOS apply the shine use <code>rel=\"apple-touch-icon\"</code>. This icon should be sized to 180x180 pixels as that is the current size recommend by Apple for the latest iPhones and iPads. I have read Blackberry will also use <code>rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\"</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As a note: Chrome for Android states: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The apple-touch-* are deprecated, and will be supported only for a short time. (Written as of beta for m31 of Chrome).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Custom Tiles for IE 11+ on Windows 8.1+</strong></p>\n\n<p>IE 11+ on Windows 8.1+ does offer a way to create pinned tiles for your site.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft recommends creating a few tiles at the following size: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Small: 128 x 128</p>\n  \n  <p>Medium:    270 x 270</p>\n  \n  <p>Wide: 558 x 270</p>\n  \n  <p>Large: 558 x 558</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These should be transparent images as we will define a color background next. </p>\n\n<p>Once these images are created you should create an xml file called <code>browserconfig.xml</code> with the following code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;browserconfig&gt;\n  &lt;msapplication&gt;\n    &lt;tile&gt;\n      &lt;square70x70logo src=\"images/smalltile.png\"/&gt;\n      &lt;square150x150logo src=\"images/mediumtile.png\"/&gt;\n      &lt;wide310x150logo src=\"images/widetile.png\"/&gt;\n      &lt;square310x310logo src=\"images/largetile.png\"/&gt;\n      &lt;TileColor&gt;#009900&lt;/TileColor&gt;\n    &lt;/tile&gt;\n  &lt;/msapplication&gt;\n&lt;/browserconfig&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Save this xml file in the root of your site. When a site is pinned IE will look for this file. If you want to name the xml file something different or have it in a different location add this meta tag to the <code>head</code>: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"msapplication-config\" content=\"path-to-browserconfig/custom-name.xml\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For additional information on IE 11+ custom tiles and using the XML file <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn455106%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\">visit Microsoft's website</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Putting it all together:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To put it all together the above code would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- For IE 9 and below. ICO should be 32x32 pixels in size --&gt;\n&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"path/to/favicon.ico\"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Touch Icons - iOS and Android 2.1+ 180x180 pixels in size. --&gt; \n&lt;link rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" href=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE 11+ and Opera. 196x196 pixels in size. --&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"path/to/favicon.png\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n   \n\n<p><strong>Windows Phone Live Tiles</strong></p>\n\n<p>If a user is using a Windows Phone they can pin a website to the start screen of their phone.

'hidden' : 'visible';\n document.getElementById('TileOverlay').style.visibility =    newVisibility;\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note on Sizes</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am using one size as every browser will scale down the image as necessary. I could add more HTML to specify multiple sizes if desired for those with a lower bandwidth but I am already compressing the PNG files heavily using <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\">TinyPNG</a> and I find this unnecessary for my purposes. Also, according to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/499917/philippe-b\">philippe_b</a>'s <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23852908/825757\">answer</a> Chrome and Firefox have bugs that cause the browser to load all sizes of icons. Using one large icon may be better than multiple smaller ones because of this. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Further Reading</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>For those who would like more details see the links below: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon\">Wikipedia Article on Favicons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://iconhandbook.co.uk/reference/chart/\">The Icon Handbook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jonathantneal.com/blog/understand-the-favicon/\">Understand the Favicon</a> by Jonathan T.

The gradient support seems a little flaky, so I've always used a fallback image instead. Modernizr lets you easily deliver different properties to browsers with different support. I've mainly used this for determining whether a browser has CSS transitions and transforms, as they are useful for any image sliders or content carousels. It's worth using the customisation tool to only include the functionality that you want – the webforms stuff shows a textbox with 50 in it for a couple of milliseconds, so it's worth disabling if you don't want it.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that's helpful!</p>\n    "},{"t":"SVG support for Internet Explorer 8 and below","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9353798/svg-support-for-internet-explorer-8-and-below","q":"\n\n<p>I created animation in flash and converted it into HTML5 using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/\">Swiffy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's using SVG to render all of it; is there some JavaScript or a trick to make IE8 and below support it?

So while it's true that Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome both rely on network-enabled geolocation via Google's Location Service database, that's not a requirement of the standard. For example, Mobile Safari on your iPhone will in some cases use GPS rather than WiFi-triangulation or cell-site geolocation, depending on what location service is most accurate and accessible at a given moment.</p>\n\n<p>And we can hope that future browsers will provide some choice of the location provider. I agree that it would be good for user privacy and functionality if browsers supported geolocation technologies that didn't require sending a list of WiFi IDs to a third party; I suspect that as GPS sensors are more often integrated into smartphones and laptops, we'll see browsers that let you use GPS sensing for the W3C Geolocation API. It might also be nice to have a feature for desktop computers where the location can be manually specified in browser settings, this would also be compatible with the current spec.</p>\n    "},{"t":"drag drop files into standard html file input","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8006715/drag-drop-files-into-standard-html-file-input","q":"\n\n<p>These days we can drag &amp; drop files into a special container and upload them with XHR 2.

Any additional insights?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> </p>\n\n<p><code>::content</code> is essentially a way to dig deeper and style descendants of the <code>ShadowHost</code>, which normally aren't available to be styled, because your CSS doesn't know to look for the ShadowDOM fragment without <code>::content</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This answer assumes you are at least somewhat familiar with the <strong><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html-templates/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>&lt;template&gt;</code></a></strong> element and <strong><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Web Components</a></strong>, specifically the <strong><a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShadowDOM</a></strong>, which deals with <code>ShadowTree</code>s and their two main elements, <code>ShadowHost</code> and <code>ShadowRoot</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> - As of this writing, there is less than 50% support (even prefixed, off-by-default support) for Web Components across the five major browsers. While all modern browsers except for Microsoft Edge (Microsoft is working on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/621390176644825088\" rel=\"nofollow\">adding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> to Edge</a>) support <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>, only recent versions of Chrome and Opera support the ShadowDOM fully; with Firefox supporting parts of it after you toggle the requisite feature in <code>about:config</code> (<code>dom.webcomponents.enabled</code>) to <strong>true</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of using the <code>ShadowDOM</code> is similar to MVC's <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\" rel=\"nofollow\">separation of concerns</a></strong>. That is, we want to separate our content from our presentation and allow for encapsulated templates in our code to help make it more manageable. We have this already in various programming languages, but it's remained a problem for some time in HTML and CSS. Further, there can be conflicts with class names when styling elements in web apps. </p>\n\n<p>Normally, we interact with the <code>LightDOM</code> (a sort of \"Light Realm\"), but sometimes it would be helpful to take advantage of encapsulation. Crossing into this sort of \"Shadow Realm\" (part of Web Components) is a new method to prevent the problems mentioned above by <strong>allowing encapsulation</strong>. Any styles applied to markup in your <code>ShadowTree</code> won't apply to markup outside of your <code>ShadowTree</code>, even if the exact same classes or selectors are used. </p>\n\n<p>When the <code>ShadowTree</code> (which lives in the <code>ShadowDOM</code>) has a tree from the <code>LightDOM</code> distributed within it, and/or when the <code>ShadowTree</code> is rendered, the result is converted by the browser into what is called a <strong><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/#composed-trees\" rel=\"nofollow\">composed tree</a></strong>. </p>\n\n<p>When the browser renders your code, content is being distributed and inserted at new locations <em>other than</em> where it was physically typed. This distributed output is what you see (and what the browser sees), and is called the <code>composed tree</code>. In reality, the content is not originally typed in the order that it now appears, but you won't know this, and neither will the browser. This separation between \"end result\" and \"original code\", if you will, is one of the main benefits of encapsulation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHxrr6Q82yI\" rel=\"nofollow\">Web Components &amp; the Future of CSS</a></strong> is a great 40-minute video on Web Components and specifically the ShadowDOM, pointed out to me by <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/2065702/zach-saucier\">ZachSaucier</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Specific to your question, the <code>::content</code> pseudo element applies to what are called <strong>distributed nodes</strong>. A distributed node is another term for whatever you put within the <code>&lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt;</code> tags. The content is <em>distributed</em> from its place in the original markup to wherever you have placed your <code>&lt;content&gt;</code> tags in the template.</p>\n\n<p>So, when you need specificity in CSS, one way you can handle selectors normally is that you go to the parent element and add that in as part of the selector.

But if I'm considering accessibility (e.g., perhaps I expect my content to be read by screen-readers), then there is a difference.  The CSS rule <code>display:none</code> might hide my content from web browsers, but a corresponding aria rule (e.g., <code>aria-hidden=\"false\"</code>) might try to read it.  Thus, I now agree that @newtron's answer is correct, though perhaps (arguably) not as clear as I might like.

But <em>you can make it harder to download</em>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Browsers make grabbing too easy</h1>\n\n<p>Because that's what browsers were designed to do: <em>Serve content</em> - which means <em>give the content to the user</em>. To show you how easy it is, here's how I usually grab videos on virtually <em>any video streaming site</em>:</p>\n\n<p>Prepare the network tab of your preferred browser debugger and let the video load. Then look for it in the loaded resources. Videos are usually streamed in .flv or .mp4, and audio in .mp3. When you spot the url, open a new tab/window and open the link there. The browser will then download the file.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Making it harder</h1>\n\n<p>Here are methods on making a grabber's life harder. Like I said earlier, these are not fool-proof methods, but can at least ward off skiddies.</p>\n\n<h2>Video to Canvas technique</h2>\n\n<p>Recently I came across <a href=\"http://html5doctor.com/video-canvas-magic/\">this article from HTML5Doctor</a> while researching motion detection in JS. This involves streaming your video via a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, then with some JS, literally copy the video to a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. <a href=\"http://html5doctor.com/demos/video-canvas-magic/demo1.html\">Here's an example</a> where the video is up front, while the canvas at the back get's fed with data from that same video.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, what you do is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Predefine on the HTML or dynamically insert a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> to the DOM. This is the \"player\" that the user sees.</li>\n<li>Dynamically create a video tag via JS, append it to the DOM hidden and give it a url to stream. This will be the video source for the canvas.</li>\n<li>Then with JS, you periodically grab data from the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> you just created and draw it to the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. With this step, the video gets fed to the canvas.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's the very basic of the entire routine. Since your player is now the canvas and the true video hidden, you can try right-clicking all you want and save. Since the canvas acts like an image on the page, you can only save a shot of a frame that was displayed on the canvas. As for controls, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/HTMLMediaElement\">JS has an API for controlling <code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> so you can create custom buttons and sliders.</p>\n\n<p>However, if they know you are doing this, they will find your hidden video element, and you are screwed. This leads us to the next method that complements this front-end only technique, with aid from the server side.</p>\n\n<h2>Temporary resource urls</h2>\n\n<p>One thing you can do to prevent this method is to <em>prevent the link from being reusable</em>. Make the link disposable, temporary, one-time use only. Once the player loads using the disposable url, dispose of it. Make it unusable.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Prevention\">CSRF prevention</a>, when a browser requests a page with your video, have it generate a random token and store it in some storage on the server side for later reference. At the same time, <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/session.idpassing.php\">append it to the url of your video</a>, something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//we load some video with id 1234324 from your site using this url\n//and the token generated on page load is appended as sid\n\nhttp://yoursite.com/media.php?video_id=1234324&amp;sid=a0s9d8a98a0d98asd09809wq0e9\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when your player loads the video, it will use this url that carries the token. Have the server validate the token. </p>\n\n<p>If it's good, stream the video and <em>destroy the token from the server</em> to avoid reuse. This essentially makes the url \"one time use only\". If an invalid token is used, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error\">return the appropriate headers as the response</a>, like a 403 perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>To add a bit more security, impose an expiry of the url by storing it's timestamp along with the token. Then compare the request timestamp with the stored timestamp if it's still within the \"use window\". Make this \"use window\" short enough to be used by the player on the page, but not long enough for a skiddie to grab that url and paste it into another tab/window/downloader.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Correct way to use Modernizr to detect IE?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13478303/correct-way-to-use-modernizr-to-detect-ie","q":"\n\n<p>This might be a stupid question, but I wanted to use the Modernizr JS library to detect for some browser properties to determine what content to show or not show.</p>\n\n<p>I have an app called <a href=\"http://gardengnomesoftware.com/pano2vr.php\">Pano2VR</a> which outputs both HTML5 and SWF.

(obvious marketing strategies).</p>\n\n<p>As a beginner on web apps development and client-side JS UI frameworks; you guys, based on your experience which one do you recommend for rapid desktop web apps development considering speed, widget collections, complexity, look n' feel, support, etc?</p>\n\n<p>Which one do you recommend me to start learning?</p>\n\n<p>I know there could be lots of answers and each one could prefer different ones, but this could help to guide me a little and have some critics of some of the most popular frameworks.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>There is so much in your question, that the answer won't be easy and won't be definite at all. It'll also be very opinionated. Looking at the list of framework you brought, I see very different things that are hardly comparable with each other. I'll try to group them somehow and add more frameworks to the list.</p>\n\n<p>The main question here is not the pros and cons of a particular framework. The main question is: <strong>how much do you want</strong>? Did you really mean an application like Gmail or Grooveshark? Or did you mean something like Stackoverflow - a dynamic and not at all simple, but still a website. Let's consider all of these options.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, you just want to enhance your website with some widgets, like tabs, dialogs, some draggable/droppable elements, text editing, etc and you are not willing to change your development model. I mean, you use your favourite Java/PHP/Ruby and do not wish to write the a lot of your app's logics and behaviour in JavaScript. In this case, jQuery-based plugin-like solutions will do for you, particularly, <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/\">jQuery UI</a> and <a href=\"http://jquerymobile.com/\">jQuery Mobile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>jQuery widgets follow its plugin system. This generally means, that they are extremely easy to use. In order to create a button, you write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#myButton').button();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now if you want to disable it, you call a method using following pattern:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#myButton').button('disable');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And getting or setting values, e.g. on slider or datepicker, looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('#mySlider').slider('value');\n$('#mySlider').slider('value', 42);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you see, jQuery-based solutions have no model. All your data is kept in DOM and is obtained via quirky method calls. If you need to dynamicly process your data, e.g. do some complex validations, load something in background, filter or sort, then you see that this will soon get messy. By the way, this is the problem why jQuery UI team has not provided a grid control yet - they can't do it without a model. In jQuery Mobile you get a nice mobile UI by the means of simple markup, but there is no official way to pass data between pages.</p>\n\n<p>Summing this up: if you have a multi-page website, if you POST your forms, then use jQuery UI or a lighter solution like <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, you want to build something more complex, more application-like (a single-page application?). You know you will need to work with data on client side. What are your options then?</p>\n\n<p>You can use one of many JavaScript frameworks that provide you with models, data binding and probably other means of creating web apps and integrate them with why not jQuery UI. Or you can use a more complete framework like <a href=\"http://www.kendoui.com/\">Kendo</a> or <a href=\"http://wijmo.com/\">Wijmo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jqwidgets.com\">jqWidgets</a>. These frameworks rely on jQuery (Wijmo relies on jQuery UI) and provide additional means of data manipulation. They have a data models. Kendo implements its own solution (I think), while Wijmo and jqWidgets integrate with the popular Knockout JS.</p>\n\n<p>So Kendo and Wijmo belong to the group of frameworks that provide both widgets/controls and some backing model. There are other frameworks like these, that are not jQuery-based, e.g. <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">Dojo Toolkit</a>. Add some dynamic data loading and you'll get a somewhat complex web application. What more can you wish?</p>\n\n<p>Actually, the most important thing is forgotten - how do you structure (organize) you application? If you try to build a single-page app that communicates with server in RESTful way, then you will soon get into a mess if your application has no architecture. The features that are usually required for this are some concern separation (MVC, MVVM), templating, routing and module management. This is where <a href=\"http://sproutcore.com/\">SproutCore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/\">Sencha</a> appear. They provide a comprehensive solution for building web apps, where widgets are just a small part. </p>\n\n<p>It may seem like SproutCore and Sencha are the winners here, because they are the most complete solutions that include both UI and the business logics and also structure your application. Despite all the pros, there are some cons. Some say they are too heavyweight or will require to adhere to their development model, which you might not like. For example, in Sencha you describe your GUI in JavaScript and use Sencha's type system. This adds a sort of heavy feeling that there are abstractions and wrappers, while you really like the ease of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>But this is not the only way. The power of web is that there are many-many frameworks, libraries, tools out there, <a href=\"http://microjs.com/\">smaller</a> and bigger ones, that will help you craft your app the way you like it. For example, consider <a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a>. It doesn't provide a set of controls itself, but combined with Twitter Bootstrap becomes a complete solution for RIA. Or, for example, look at <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\">EmberJS</a>, a more lightweight framework from the guy who created the heavyweight SproutCore. It doesn't provide you with a set of widgets either, but is, in my opinion, a very good base for an app.</p>\n\n<p>So here is my final thought instead of conclusion. All those framework usually show you their widget set, nicely looking themes and the other visual stuff. But what really matters is how you will actually develop you application, how you will structure it, where you will implement your logic. Get to know what the framework provides and think through whether you can substitute what's missing.</p>\n    "},{"t":"What’s the point of using the HTML5 <time> tag?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6852866/what-s-the-point-of-using-the-html5-time-tag","q":"\n\n<p>I have been going through some tutorials on the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag, but I honestly don't see why we are using it.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Published &lt;time pubdate datetime=\"2011-07-03\"&gt;07/03&lt;/time&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we are going to have a string 07/03 anyway, what is the purpose of using a time tag?\nIt doesn't validate anything.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>The point of this tag, as with a number of the new \"semantic\" HTML5 tags, is to make it easier for programs to index your data.</p>\n\n<p>A script can go through and easily find out what the published date is for your blog articles if it sees a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag, without having to parse any of a number of ways this could be represented (for consumption by a human being), which would be a much more complex and error-prone task.</p>\n    "},{"t":"How to display an unordered list in two columns?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14745297/how-to-display-an-unordered-list-in-two-columns","q":"\n\n<p>With the following html what is the easiest method to display the list as two columns</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;B&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;D&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;E&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Desired display:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A B\nC D\nE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Edit: Need to mention that the solution needs to work on IE :(\nThanks</p>\n    ","a":"\n<h2>Modern Browsers</h2>\n\n<p>leverage the css3 columns module to support what you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_columns.asp\">http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_columns.asp</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>ul {\n  columns: 2;\n  -webkit-columns: 2;\n  -moz-columns: 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/HP85j/8/\">http://jsfiddle.net/HP85j/8/</a></p>\n\n<h2>Legacy Browsers</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for IE support you will need a code solution that involves JavaScript and dom manipulation.
