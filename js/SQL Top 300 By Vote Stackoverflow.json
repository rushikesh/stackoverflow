[{"t":"How can I prevent SQL-injection in PHP?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php","q":"\n\n<p>If user input is inserted without modification into an SQL query, then the application becomes vulnerable to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/332367/\">SQL injection</a>, like in the following example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$unsafe_variable = $_POST['user_input']; \n\nmysql_query(\"INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES ('$unsafe_variable')\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's because the user can input something like <code>value'); DROP TABLE table;--</code>, and the query becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO `table` (`column`) VALUES('value'); DROP TABLE table;--')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What can be done to prevent this from happening?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p><strong>Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.</strong> These are SQL statements that are sent to and parsed by the database server separately from any parameters. This way it is impossible for an attacker to inject malicious SQL.</p>\n\n<p>You basically have two options to achieve this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Using <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php\">PDO</a> (for any supported database driver):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = :name');\n\n$stmt-&gt;execute(array('name' =&gt; $name));\n\nforeach ($stmt as $row) {\n    // do something with $row\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Using <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php\">MySQLi</a> (for MySQL):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$stmt = $dbConnection-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');\n$stmt-&gt;bind_param('s', $name);\n\n$stmt-&gt;execute();\n\n$result = $stmt-&gt;get_result();\nwhile ($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {\n    // do something with $row\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you're connecting to a database other than MySQL, there is a driver-specific second option that you can refer to (e.g. <code>pg_prepare()</code> and <code>pg_execute()</code> for PostgreSQL). PDO is the universal option.</p>\n\n<h2>Correctly setting up the connection</h2>\n\n<p>Note that when using <code>PDO</code> to access a MySQL database <em>real</em> prepared statements are <strong>not used by default</strong>. To fix this you have to disable the emulation of prepared statements. An example of creating a connection using PDO is:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$dbConnection = new PDO('mysql:dbname=dbtest;host=127.0.0.1;charset=utf8', 'user', 'pass');\n\n$dbConnection-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);\n$dbConnection-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example the error mode isn't strictly necessary, <strong>but it is advised to add it</strong>. This way the script will not stop with a <code>Fatal Error</code> when something goes wrong. And it gives the developer the chance to <code>catch</code> any error(s) which are <code>throw</code>n as <code>PDOException</code>s.</p>\n\n<p>What is <strong>mandatory</strong> however is the first <code>setAttribute()</code> line, which tells PDO to disable emulated prepared statements and use <em>real</em> prepared statements. This makes sure the statement and the values aren't parsed by PHP before sending it to the MySQL server (giving a possible attacker no chance to inject malicious SQL).</p>\n\n<p>Although you can set the <code>charset</code> in the options of the constructor, it's important to note that 'older' versions of PHP (&lt; 5.3.6) <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php\">silently ignored the charset parameter</a> in the DSN.</p>\n\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n\n<p>What happens is that the SQL statement you pass to <code>prepare</code> is parsed and compiled by the database server. By specifying parameters (either a <code>?</code> or a named parameter like <code>:name</code> in the example above) you tell the database engine where you want to filter on. Then when you call <code>execute</code>, the prepared statement is combined with the parameter values you specify. </p>\n\n<p>The important thing here is that the parameter values are combined with the compiled statement, not an SQL string. SQL injection works by tricking the script into including malicious strings when it creates SQL to send to the database. So by sending the actual SQL separately from the parameters, you limit the risk of ending up with something you didn't intend. Any parameters you send when using a prepared statement will just be treated as strings (although the database engine may do some optimization so parameters may end up as numbers too, of course). In the example above, if the <code>$name</code> variable contains <code>'Sarah'; DELETE FROM employees</code> the result would simply be a search for the string <code>\"'Sarah'; DELETE FROM employees\"</code>, and you will not end up with <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/327/\">an empty table</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit with using prepared statements is that if you execute the same statement many times in the same session it will only be parsed and compiled once, giving you some speed gains.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and since you asked about how to do it for an insert, here's an example (using PDO):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-php prettyprint-override\"><code>$preparedStatement = $db-&gt;prepare('INSERT INTO table (column) VALUES (:column)');\n\n$preparedStatement-&gt;execute(array('column' =&gt; $unsafeValue));\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Can Prepared Statements Be Used For Dynamic Queries?</h2>\n\n<p>While you can still use prepared statements for the query parameters, the structure of the dynamic query itself cannot be parametrized and certain query features (e.g. <code>LIMIT $start, $number</code>) cannot be parametrized.</p>\n\n<p>For example, this will <strong>not work</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT ?, ?'); // Bad query\n$stmt-&gt;execute(array(0, 30));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For these specific scenarios, the best thing to do is use a whitelist filter that restricts the possible values or the possible characters.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Value whitelist\n  // $dir can only be 'DESC' or 'ASC'\n$dir = !empty($direction) ? 'DESC' : 'ASC';\n\n// Character set whitelist\n  // $offset will never contain a non-numeric character\n$offset = preg_replace('/[^0-9]+/', '', $offset);\nif (empty($offset)) {\n    $offset = 0;\n}\n\n// Explicit data types\n  // $number will always be an integer. We use a binary AND operation\n  // ($number &amp; PHP_INT_MAX) to prevent integer overflows from creating\n  // invalid characters from alternative notation.\n$number = (int) ($number &lt; 0 ? 1 : ($number &amp; PHP_INT_MAX));\n\n$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare(\n    'SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name '.$dir.' LIMIT '.$offset.', '.$number\n);\n</code></pre>\n    "},{"t":"Difference between INNER and OUTER joins","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38549/difference-between-inner-and-outer-joins","q":"\n\n<p>What is the difference between <code>INNER JOIN</code> and <code>OUTER JOIN</code>?</p>\n\n<p>How do <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>, and <code>FULL JOIN</code> fit in?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>Assuming you're joining on columns with no duplicates, which is a very common case:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a venn diagram intersection.</p></li>\n<li><p>An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn diagram</a> union.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n\n<p>Suppose you have two tables, with a single column each, and data as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A    B\n-    -\n1    3\n2    4\n3    5\n4    6\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inner join</strong></p>\n\n<p>An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;\nselect a.*,b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;\n\na | b\n--+--\n3 | 3\n4 | 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Left outer join</strong></p>\n\n<p>A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;\nselect a.*,b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);\n\na |  b\n--+-----\n1 | null\n2 | null\n3 |    3\n4 |    4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Full outer join</strong></p>\n\n<p>A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B.

But there are several very easy ways to accomplish what is\n  expected using existing functionality.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are 3 possible solutions: using INSERT IGNORE, REPLACE, or\n  INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE.</p>\n  \n  <p>Imagine we have a table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `transcripts` (\n`ensembl_transcript_id` varchar(20) NOT NULL,\n`transcript_chrom_start` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\n`transcript_chrom_end` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,\nPRIMARY KEY (`ensembl_transcript_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Now imagine that we have an automatic pipeline importing transcripts\n  meta-data from Ensembl, and that due to various reasons the pipeline\n  might be broken at any step of execution. Thus, we need to ensure two\n  things: 1) repeated executions of the pipeline will not destroy our\n  database, and 2) repeated executions will not die due to ‘duplicate\n  primary key’ errors.</p>\n  \n  <p>Method 1: using REPLACE</p>\n  \n  <p>It’s very simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>REPLACE INTO `transcripts`\nSET `ensembl_transcript_id` = ‘ENSORGT00000000001′,\n`transcript_chrom_start` = 12345,\n`transcript_chrom_end` = 12678;\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>If the record exists, it will be overwritten; if it does not yet\n  exist, it will be created. However, using this method isn’t efficient\n  for our case: we do not need to overwrite existing records, it’s fine\n  just to skip them.</p>\n  \n  <p>Method 2: using INSERT IGNORE Also very simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT IGNORE INTO `transcripts`\nSET `ensembl_transcript_id` = ‘ENSORGT00000000001′,\n`transcript_chrom_start` = 12345,\n`transcript_chrom_end` = 12678;\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Here, if the ‘ensembl_transcript_id’ is already present in the\n  database, it will be silently skipped (ignored). (To be more precise,\n  here’s a quote from MySQL reference manual: “If you use the IGNORE\n  keyword, errors that occur while executing the INSERT statement are\n  treated as warnings instead. For example, without IGNORE, a row that\n  duplicates an existing UNIQUE index or PRIMARY KEY value in the table\n  causes a duplicate-key error and the statement is aborted.”.) If the\n  record doesn’t yet exist, it will be created.</p>\n  \n  <p>This second method has several potential weaknesses, including\n  non-abortion of the query in case any other problem occurs (see the\n  manual). Thus it should be used if previously tested without the\n  IGNORE keyword.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is one more option: to use INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE\n  syntax, and in the UPDATE part just do nothing do some meaningless\n  (empty) operation, like calculating 0+0 (Geoffray suggests doing the\n  id=id assignment for the MySQL optimization engine to ignore this\n  operation). Advantage of this method is that it only ignores duplicate\n  key events, and still aborts on other errors.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a final notice: this post was inspired by Xaprb.

For example, using the data set you showed in your question:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO ClosureTable (ancestor_id, descendant_id) VALUES\n  (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,6),\n  (2,2), (2,4),\n  (3,3), (3,5),\n  (4,4),\n  (5,5),\n  (6,6);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can get a tree starting at node 1 like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT f.* \nFROM FlatTable f \n  JOIN ClosureTable a ON (f.id = a.descendant_id)\nWHERE a.ancestor_id = 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output (in MySQL client) looks like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+----+\n| id |\n+----+\n|  1 | \n|  2 | \n|  4 | \n|  6 | \n+----+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In other words, nodes 3 and 5 are excluded, because they're part of a separate hierarchy, not descending from node 1.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Re: comment from e-satis about immediate children (or immediate parent).  You can add a \"<code>path_length</code>\" column to the <code>ClosureTable</code> to make it easier to query specifically for an immediate child or parent (or any other distance).</p>\n\n<pre><code>INSERT INTO ClosureTable (ancestor_id, descendant_id, path_length) VALUES\n  (1,1,0), (1,2,1), (1,4,2), (1,6,1),\n  (2,2,0), (2,4,1),\n  (3,3,0), (3,5,1),\n  (4,4,0),\n  (5,5,0),\n  (6,6,0);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you can add a term in your search for querying the immediate children of a given node.

Then you join your table to the sub-query with equality on both <code>group-identifier</code> and <code>max-value-in-group</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select yt.id, yt.rev, yt.contents\nfrom YourTable yt\ninner join(\n    select id, max(rev) rev\n    from YourTable\n    group by id\n) ss on yt.id = ss.id and yt.rev = ss.rev\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Left Joining with self, tweaking join conditions and filters</h2>\n\n<p>In this approach, you left join the table with itself. Equality, of course, goes in the <code>group-identifier</code>. Then, 2 smart moves: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The second join condition is having left side value less than right value</li>\n<li>When you do step 1, the row(s) that actually have the max value will have <code>NULL</code> in the right side (it's a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, remember?). Then, we filter the joined result, showing only the rows where the right side is <code>NULL</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So you end up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select yt1.*\nfrom yourtable yt1\nleft outer join yourtable yt2\non (yt1.id = yt2.id and yt1.rev &lt; yt2.rev)\nwhere yt2.id is null;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Both approaches bring the exact same result. </p>\n\n<p>If you have two rows with <code>max-value-in-group</code> for <code>group-identifier</code>, both rows will be in the result in both approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Both approaches are SQL ANSI compatible, thus, will work with your favorite RDBMS, regardless of its \"flavor\".</p>\n\n<p>Both approaches are also performance friendly, however your mileage may vary (RDBMS, DB Structure, Indexes, etc.).

Additionally <code>sql.Date</code> isn't tied to timezones.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/sql/Time.html\"><code>java.sql.Time</code></a> corresponds to SQL TIME and as should be obvious, only contains information about <em>hour, minutes, seconds and milliseconds</em>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/sql/Timestamp.html\"><code>java.sql.Timestamp</code></a> corresponds to SQL TIMESTAMP which is exact date to the nanosecond (<em>note that <code>util.Date</code> only supports milliseconds!</em>) with customizable precision.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>One of the most common bugs when using JDBC drivers in relation to these three types is that the types are handled incorrectly.</strong> This means that <code>sql.Date</code> is timezone specific, <code>sql.Time</code> contains current year, month and day et cetera et cetera.</p>\n\n<h2>Finally: Which one to use?</h2>\n\n<p>Depends on the SQL type of the field, really. <code>PreparedStatement</code> has setters for all three values, <code>#setDate()</code> being the one for <code>sql.Date</code>, <code>#setTime()</code> for <code>sql.Time</code> and <code>#setTimestamp()</code> for <code>sql.Timestamp</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Do note that if you use <code>ps.setObject(fieldIndex, utilDateObject);</code> you can actually give a normal <code>util.Date</code> to most JDBC drivers which will happily devour it as if it was of the correct type but when you request the data afterwards, you may notice that you're actually missing stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>I'm really saying that none of the Dates should be used at all.</h2>\n\n<p>What I am saying that save the milliseconds/nanoseconds as plain longs and convert them to whatever objects you are using (<em><a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/\">obligatory joda-time plug</a></em>).

It also improves the performance to dispose the context after SaveChanges and create a new one. This clears the context from all entites, <code>SaveChanges</code> doesn't do that, the entities are still attached to the context in state <code>Unchanged</code>.

E.g. performance is terrible, it's cool for simple apps but can only take you so far.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nCan you concentrate on EF VS L2S VS SPs rather than ORM VS SPs. I'm mainly interested by EF VS L2S. But am keen to have them compared against stored procs too since plain SQl is something I know a lot about.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>First off, if you're starting a new project, go with Entity Framework (\"EF\") - it now generates much better SQL (more like Linq to SQL does) and is easier to maintain and more powerful than Linq to SQL (\"L2S\").  As of the release of .NET 4.0, I consider Linq to SQL to be an obsolete technology.  MS has been very open about not continuing L2S development further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is tricky to answer.  For most single-entity operations (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\">CRUD</a>) you will find just about equivalent performance with all three technologies.  You do have to know how EF and Linq to SQL work in order to use them to their fullest.  For high-volume operations like polling queries, you may want to have EF/L2S \"compile\" your entity query such that the framework doesn't have to constantly regenerate the SQL, or you can run into scalability issues.  (see edits)</p>\n\n<p>For bulk updates where you're updating massive amounts of data, raw SQL or a stored procedure will always perform better than an ORM solution because you don't have to marshal the data over the wire to the ORM to perform updates.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Speed of Development</strong></p>\n\n<p>In most scenarios, EF will blow away naked SQL/stored procs when it comes to speed of development.  The EF designer can update your model from your database as it changes (upon request), so you don't run into synchronization issues between your object code and your database code.  The only time I would not consider using an ORM is when you're doing a reporting/dashboard type application where you aren't doing any updating, or when you're creating an application just to do raw data maintenance operations on a database.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Neat/Maintainable code</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hands down, EF beats SQL/sprocs.  Because your relationships are modeled, joins in your code are relatively infrequent.  The relationships of the entities are almost self-evident to the reader for most queries.  Nothing is worse than having to go from tier to tier debugging or through multiple SQL/middle tier in order to understand what's actually happening to your data.  EF brings your data model into your code in a very powerful way.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>4) Flexibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stored procs and raw SQL are more \"flexible\".  You can leverage sprocs and SQL to generate faster queries for the odd specific case, and you can leverage native DB functionality easier than you can with and ORM.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>5) Overall</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't get caught up in the <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/shimmer-floor-wax/1056743/\">false dichotomy</a> of choosing an ORM vs using stored procedures.</strong>  You can use both in the same application, and you probably should.  Big bulk operations should go in stored procedures or SQL (which can actually be called by the EF), and EF should be used for your CRUD operations and most of your middle-tier's needs.  Perhaps you'd choose to use SQL for writing your reports.  I guess the moral of the story is the same as it's always been.  Use the right tool for the job.  But the skinny of it is, EF is very good nowadays (as of .NET 4.0).  Spend some real time reading and understanding it in depth and you can create some amazing, high-performance apps with ease.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: EF 5 simplifies this part a bit with <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/efdesign/archive/2011/06/30/auto-compiled-linq-queries-entity-framework-june-2011-ctp.aspx\">auto-compiled LINQ Queries</a>, but for real high volume stuff, you'll definitely need to test and analyze what fits best for you in the real world.</p>\n    "},{"t":"How do I see what character set a database / table / column is in MySQL?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1049728/how-do-i-see-what-character-set-a-database-table-column-is-in-mysql","q":"\n\n<p>How do I see what the character set that a MySQL database, table and column are in?

We have a table that identifies the model and the table with the available stock in it. As you can see, the data in the <code>model</code> column of the <code>cars</code> table relates to the <code>models</code> column of the <code>cars</code> table we have. Now, we know that the models table has an ID of <code>1</code> for <code>Sports</code> so lets write the join.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    ID,\n    model\nfrom\n    cars\n        join models\n            on model=ID\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this query looks good right? We have identified the two tables and contain the information we need and use a join that correctly identifies what columns to join on.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR 1052 (23000): Column 'ID' in field list is ambiguous\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Oh noes! An error in our first query! Yes, and it is a plum. You see, the query has indeed got the right columns, but some of them exist in both tables, so the database gets confused about what actual column we mean and where. There are two solutions to solve this. The first is nice and simple, we can use <code>tableName.columnName</code> to tell the database exactly what we mean, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    cars.ID,\n    models.model\nfrom\n    cars\n        join models\n            on cars.model=models.ID\n\n+----+--------+\n| ID | model  |\n+----+--------+\n|  1 | Sports |\n|  3 | Sports |\n|  8 | Sports |\n| 10 | Sports |\n|  2 | Sedan  |\n|  4 | Sedan  |\n|  5 | 4WD    |\n|  7 | 4WD    |\n|  9 | 4WD    |\n|  6 | Luxury |\n+----+--------+\n10 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The other is probably more often used and is called table aliasing. The tables in this example have nice and short simple names, but typing out something like <code>KPI_DAILY_SALES_BY_DEPARTMENT</code> would probably get old quickly, so a simple way is to nickname the table like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, back to the request. As you can see we have the information we need, but we also have information that wasn't asked for, so we need to include a where clause in the statement to only get the Sports cars as was asked. As I prefer the table alias method rather than using the table names over and over, I will stick to it from this point onwards.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, we need to add a where clause to our query. We can identify Sports cars either by <code>ID=1</code> or <code>model='Sports'</code>. As the ID is indexed and the primary key (and it happens to be less typing), lets use that in our query.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n\n+----+--------+\n| ID | model  |\n+----+--------+\n|  1 | Sports |\n|  3 | Sports |\n|  8 | Sports |\n| 10 | Sports |\n+----+--------+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Bingo! The boss is happy. Of course, being a boss and never being happy with what he asked for, he looks at the information, then says <em>I want the colors as well</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so we have a good part of our query already written, but we need to use a third table which is colors. Now, our main information table <code>cars</code> stores the car color ID and this links back to the colors ID column. So, in a similar manner to the original, we can join a third table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n\n+----+--------+\n| ID | model  |\n+----+--------+\n|  1 | Sports |\n|  3 | Sports |\n|  8 | Sports |\n| 10 | Sports |\n+----+--------+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Damn, although the table was correctly joined and the related columns were linked, we forgot to pull in the actual <em>information</em> from the new table that we just linked.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n\n+----+--------+-------+\n| ID | model  | color |\n+----+--------+-------+\n|  1 | Sports | Red   |\n|  8 | Sports | Green |\n| 10 | Sports | White |\n|  3 | Sports | Black |\n+----+--------+-------+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Right, that's the boss off our back for a moment. Now, to explain some of this in a little more detail. As you can see, the <code>from</code> clause in our statement links our main table (I often use a table that contains information rather than a lookup or dimension table. The query would work just as well with the tables all switched around, but make less sense when we come back to this query to read it in a few months time, so it is often best to try to write a query that will be nice and easy to understand - lay it out intuitively, use nice indenting so that everything is as clear as it can be. If you go on to teach others, try to instill these characteristics in their queries - especially if you will be troubleshooting them.</p>\n\n<p>It is entirely possible to keep linking more and more tables in this manner.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While I forgot to include a table where we might want to join more than one column in the <code>join</code> statement, here is an example. If the <code>models</code> table had brand-specific models and therefore also had a column called <code>brand</code> which linked back to the <code>brands</code> table on the <code>ID</code> field, it could be done as this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\n            and b.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see, the query above not only links the joined tables to the main <code>cars</code> table, but also specifies joins between the already joined tables. If this wasn't done, the result is called a cartesian join - which is dba speak for bad. A cartesian join is one where rows are returned because the information doesn't tell the database how to limit the results, so the query returns <em>all</em> the rows that fit the criteria.</p>\n\n<p>So, to give an example of a cartesian join, lets run the following query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n\n+----+--------+\n| ID | model  |\n+----+--------+\n|  1 | Sports |\n|  1 | Sedan  |\n|  1 | 4WD    |\n|  1 | Luxury |\n|  2 | Sports |\n|  2 | Sedan  |\n|  2 | 4WD    |\n|  2 | Luxury |\n|  3 | Sports |\n|  3 | Sedan  |\n|  3 | 4WD    |\n|  3 | Luxury |\n|  4 | Sports |\n|  4 | Sedan  |\n|  4 | 4WD    |\n|  4 | Luxury |\n|  5 | Sports |\n|  5 | Sedan  |\n|  5 | 4WD    |\n|  5 | Luxury |\n|  6 | Sports |\n|  6 | Sedan  |\n|  6 | 4WD    |\n|  6 | Luxury |\n|  7 | Sports |\n|  7 | Sedan  |\n|  7 | 4WD    |\n|  7 | Luxury |\n|  8 | Sports |\n|  8 | Sedan  |\n|  8 | 4WD    |\n|  8 | Luxury |\n|  9 | Sports |\n|  9 | Sedan  |\n|  9 | 4WD    |\n|  9 | Luxury |\n| 10 | Sports |\n| 10 | Sedan  |\n| 10 | 4WD    |\n| 10 | Luxury |\n+----+--------+\n40 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Good god, that's ugly. However, as far as the database is concerned, it is <em>exactly</em> what was asked for. In the query, we asked for for the <code>ID</code> from <code>cars</code> and the <code>model</code> from <code>models</code>. However, because we didn't specify <em>how</em> to join the tables, the database has matched <em>every</em> row from the first table with <em>every</em> row from the second table.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so the boss is back, and he wants more information again. <em>I want the same list, but also include 4WDs in it</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This however, gives us a great excuse to look at two different ways to accomplish this. We could add another condition to the where clause like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n    or b.ID=3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While the above will work perfectly well, lets look at it differently, this is a great excuse to show how a <code>union</code> query will work.</p>\n\n<p>We know that the following will return all the Sports cars:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the following would return all the 4WDs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So by adding a <code>union all</code> clause between them, the results of the second query will be appended to the results of the first query.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=1\nunion all\nselect\n    a.ID,\n    b.model,\n    c.color\nfrom\n    cars a\n        join models b\n            on a.model=b.ID\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\n        join brands d\n            on a.brand=d.ID\nwhere\n    b.ID=3\n\n+----+--------+-------+\n| ID | model  | color |\n+----+--------+-------+\n|  1 | Sports | Red   |\n|  8 | Sports | Green |\n| 10 | Sports | White |\n|  3 | Sports | Black |\n|  5 | 4WD    | Green |\n|  7 | 4WD    | White |\n|  9 | 4WD    | Black |\n+----+--------+-------+\n7 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the results of the first query are returned first, followed by the results of the second query.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, it would of course have been much easier to simply use the first query, but <code>union</code> queries can be great for specific cases. They are a great way to return specific results from tables from tables that aren't easily joined together - or for that matter <em>completely</em> unrelated tables. There are a few rules to follow however.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The column types from the first query must match the column types from every other query below.</li>\n<li>The names of the columns from the first query will be used to identify the entire set of results.</li>\n<li>The number of columns in each query must be the same.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, you might <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49925/what-is-the-difference-between-union-and-union-all\">be wondering what the</a> difference is between using <code>union</code> and <code>union all</code>. A <code>union</code> query will remove duplicates, while a <code>union all</code> will not. This does mean that there is a small performance hit when using <code>union</code> over <code>union all</code> but the results may be worth it - I won't speculate on that sort of thing in this though.</p>\n\n<p>On this note, it might be worth noting some additional notes here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we wanted to order the results, we can use an <code>order by</code> but you can't use the alias anymore. In the query above, appending an <code>order by a.ID</code> would result in an error - as far as the results are concerned, the column is called <code>ID</code> rather than <code>a.ID</code> - even though the same alias has been used in both queries.</li>\n<li>We can only have one <code>order by</code> statement, and it must be as the last statement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the next examples, I am adding a few extra rows to our tables.</p>\n\n<p>I have added <code>Holden</code> to the brands table.\nI have also added a row into <code>cars</code> that has the <code>color</code> value of <code>12</code> - which has no reference in the colors table.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, the boss is back again, barking requests out - *I want a count of each brand we carry and the number of cars in it!` - Typical, we just get to an interesting section of our discussion and the boss wants more work.</p>\n\n<p>Rightyo, so the first thing we need to do is get a complete listing of possible brands.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.brand\nfrom\n    brands a\n\n+--------+\n| brand  |\n+--------+\n| Ford   |\n| Toyota |\n| Nissan |\n| Smart  |\n| BMW    |\n| Holden |\n+--------+\n6 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, when we join this to our cars table we get the following result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.brand\nfrom\n    brands a\n        join cars b\n            on a.ID=b.brand\ngroup by\n    a.brand\n\n+--------+\n| brand  |\n+--------+\n| BMW    |\n| Ford   |\n| Nissan |\n| Smart  |\n| Toyota |\n+--------+\n5 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which is of course a problem - we aren't seeing any mention of the lovely <code>Holden</code> brand I added.</p>\n\n<p>This is because a join looks for matching rows in <em>both</em> tables. As there is no data in cars that is of type <code>Holden</code> it isn't returned. This is where we can use an <code>outer</code> join.

The Left or Right defines which table is <em>fully</em> included. A <code>left outer join</code> will include all the rows from the table on the left, while (you guessed it) a <code>right outer join</code> brings all the results from the table on the right into the results.</p>\n\n<p>Some databases will allow a <code>full outer join</code> which will bring back results (whether matched or not) from <em>both</em> tables, but this isn't supported in all databases.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I probably figure at this point in time, you are wondering whether or not you can merge join types in a query - and the answer is yes, you absolutely can.</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    b.brand,\n    c.color,\n    count(a.id) as countOfBrand\nfrom\n    cars a\n        right outer join brands b\n            on b.ID=a.brand\n        join colors c\n            on a.color=c.ID\ngroup by\n    a.brand,\n    c.color\n\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n| brand  | color | countOfBrand |\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n| Ford   | Blue  |            1 |\n| Ford   | White |            1 |\n| Toyota | Black |            1 |\n| Toyota | Green |            2 |\n| Toyota | Red   |            1 |\n| Nissan | Black |            1 |\n| Smart  | White |            1 |\n| BMW    | Blue  |            1 |\n| BMW    | White |            1 |\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n9 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, why is that not the results that were expected? It is because although we have selected the outer join from cars to brands, it wasn't specified in the join to colors - so that particular join will only bring back results that match in both tables.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the query that would work to get the results that we expected:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.brand,\n    c.color,\n    count(b.id) as countOfBrand\nfrom\n    brands a\n        left outer join cars b\n            on a.ID=b.brand\n        left outer join colors c\n            on b.color=c.ID\ngroup by\n    a.brand,\n    c.color\n\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n| brand  | color | countOfBrand |\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n| BMW    | Blue  |            1 |\n| BMW    | White |            1 |\n| Ford   | Blue  |            1 |\n| Ford   | White |            1 |\n| Holden | NULL  |            0 |\n| Nissan | Black |            1 |\n| Smart  | White |            1 |\n| Toyota | NULL  |            1 |\n| Toyota | Black |            1 |\n| Toyota | Green |            2 |\n| Toyota | Red   |            1 |\n+--------+-------+--------------+\n11 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we can see, we have two outer joins in the query and the results are coming through as expected.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how about those other types of joins you ask? What about Intersections?</p>\n\n<p>Well, not all databases support the <code>intersection</code> but pretty much all databases will allow you to create an intersection through a join (or a well structured where statement at the least).</p>\n\n<p>An Intersection is a type of join somewhat similar to a <code>union</code> as described above - but the difference is that it <em>only</em> returns rows of data that are identical (and I do mean identical) between the various individual queries joined by the union. Only rows that are identical in every regard will be returned.</p>\n\n<p>A simple example would be as such:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    *\nfrom\n    colors\nwhere\n    ID&gt;2\nintersect\nselect\n    *\nfrom\n    colors\nwhere\n    id&lt;4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While a normal <code>union</code> query would return all the rows of the table (the first query returning anything over <code>ID&gt;2</code> and the second anything having <code>ID&lt;4</code>) which would result in a full set, an intersect query would only return the row matching <code>id=3</code> as it meets both criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if your database doesn't support an <code>intersect</code> query, the above can be easily accomlished with the following query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select\n    a.ID,\n    a.color,\n    a.paint\nfrom\n    colors a\n        join colors b\n            on a.ID=b.ID\nwhere\n    a.ID&gt;2\n    and b.ID&lt;4\n\n+----+-------+----------+\n| ID | color | paint    |\n+----+-------+----------+\n|  3 | Blue  | Metallic |\n+----+-------+----------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you wish to perform an intersection across two different tables using a database that doesn't inherently support an intersection query, you will need to create a join on <em>every column</em> of the tables.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Hibernate show real SQL [duplicate]","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2536829/hibernate-show-real-sql","q":"\n\n<div class=\"question-status question-originals-of-duplicate\">\n    <p>This question already has an answer here:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>\n            <a href=\"/questions/1710476/print-query-string-in-hibernate-with-parameter-values\" dir=\"ltr\">Print query string in hibernate with parameter values</a>\n                <span class=\"question-originals-answer-count\">\n                    15 answers\n                </span>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n<p>if I set</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;property name=\"show_sql\"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in my <strong>hibernate.cfg.xml</strong> configuration file in the console I can see the SQL.</p>\n\n<p>But it's not <em>real</em> SQL...

So The error mainly happen when there is a field/column type of TEXT or BLOB or those belongs to TEXT or BLOB types such as TINYBLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB, TINYTEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, and LONGTEXT that you try to make as primary key or index. With full BLOB or TEXT without the length value, MySQL is unable to guarantee the uniqueness of the column as it’s of variable and dynamic size. So, when using BLOB or TEXT types as index, the value of N must be supplied so that MySQL can determine the key length. However, MySQL doesn’t support a key length limit on TEXT or BLOB. TEXT(88) simply won’t work.</p>\n\n<p>The error will also pop up when you try to convert a table column from non-TEXT and non-BLOB type such as VARCHAR and ENUM into TEXT or BLOB type, with the column already been defined as unique constraints or index. The Alter Table SQL command will fail.</p>\n\n<p>The solution to the problem is to remove the TEXT or BLOB column from the index or unique constraint, or set another field as primary key. If you can’t do that, and wanting to place a limit on the TEXT or BLOB column, try to use VARCHAR type and place a limit of length on it. By default, VARCHAR is limited to a maximum of 255 characters and its limit must be specified implicitly within a bracket right after its declaration, i.e VARCHAR(200) will limit it to 200 characters long only.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, even though you don’t use TEXT or BLOB related type in your table, the Error 1170 may also appear. It happens in situation such as when you specify VARCHAR column as primary key, but wrongly set its length or characters size. VARCHAR can only accepts up to 256 characters, so anything such as VARCHAR(512) will force MySQL to auto-convert the VARCHAR(512) to a SMALLTEXT datatype, which subsequently fail with error 1170 on key length if the column is used as primary key or unique or non-unique index.

How can I tell?

Automatically created indexes are visible in <code>\\d</code> output for a table, too.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/indexes-unique.html\">documentation on unique indexes</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PostgreSQL automatically creates an index for each unique constraint and primary key constraint to enforce uniqueness.

So, you have to choose the length. I cannot think of a name &gt; 20 chars, but you will never know. But instead of using 20, I always round up to the next 2^n number. In this case, I would choose 32 as the length. I do that, because from an computer scientist point of view, a number 2^n looks more <code>even</code> to me than other numbers and I'm just assuming that the architecture underneath can handle those numbers slightly better than others.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, MSSQL server for example, sets the default length value to 50, when you choose to create a varchar column. That makes me thinking about it. Why 50? is it just a random number, or based on average column length, or what?</p>\n\n<p>It could also be - or probably is - that different SQL servers implementations (like MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, ...) have different best column length values.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>No DBMS I know of has any \"optimization\" that will make a VARCHAR with a 2^n length perform better than one with a max. length that is not a power of 2.</p>\n\n<p>I think early SQL Server versions actually treated a VARCHAR with length 255 differently than one with a higher maximum length. I don't know if this is still the case. </p>\n\n<p>For almost all DBMS the actual storage that is required is only determined by the number of characters you put into it, not the max. length you define. So from a storage point of view (and most probably a performance one as well) it does not make any difference whether you declare a column as VARCHAR(100) or VACHAR(500). </p>\n\n<p>You should see the max. length provided for a VARCHAR column as a kind of constraint (or business rule) rather than a technical/physical thing.</p>\n\n<p>For PostgreSQL the best setup is to use <code>text</code> without a length restriction and a <code>CHECK CONSTRAINT</code> that limits the number of characters to whatever your business requires. </p>\n\n<p>If that requirement changes, altering the check constraint is much faster than altering the table (because the table does not need to be re-written)</p>\n\n<p>The same can be applied for Oracle and others - in Oracle it would be <code>VARCHAR(4000)</code> instead of <code>text</code> though. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know if there is a physical storage difference between VARCHAR(max) and e.g. VARCHAR(500) in SQL Server. But apparently there is a performance impact when using <code>varchar(max)</code> as compared to <code>varchar(8000)</code>. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://rusanu.com/2010/03/22/performance-comparison-of-varcharmax-vs-varcharn/\">this link</a> (posted by Erwin Brandstetter as a comment)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2013-09-22</strong></p>\n\n<p>Regarding bigown's comment: </p>\n\n<p>In Postgres versions before 9.2 (which was not available when I wrote the initial answer) a change to the column definition <em>did</em> rewrite the whole table, see e.g. <a href=\"http://blog.endpoint.com/2012/11/postgres-alter-column-problems-and.html\">here</a>. Since 9.2 this is no longer the case and a quick test confirmed that increasing the column size for a table with 1.2 million rows indeed only took 0.5 seconds. </p>\n\n<p>For Oracle this seems to be true as well, judging by the time it takes to alter a big table's varchar column. But I could not find any reference for that.</p>\n\n<p>For MySQL <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/alter-table.html#idm47496385802240\">the manual says</a> \"<em>In most cases, ALTER TABLE makes a temporary copy of the original table</em>\". And my own tests confirm that: running an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> on a table with 1.2 million rows (the same as in my test with Postgres) to increase the size of a column took 1.5 minutes. In MySQL however you can <em>not</em> use the \"workaround\" to use a check constraint to limit the number of characters in a column.</p>\n\n<p>For SQL Server I could not find a clear statement on this but the execution time to increase the size of a varchar column (again the 1.2 million rows table from above) indicates that <strong>no</strong> rewrite takes place. </p>\n    "},{"t":"Storing sex (gender) in database","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4175878/storing-sex-gender-in-database","q":"\n\n<p>I want to store a users gender in a database with as little (size/performance) cost as possible.</p>\n\n<p>So far, 3 scenarios come to mind</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Int</strong> - <em>aligned with Enum in code (1 = Male, 2 = Female, 3 = Hopefully no need for this?)</em></li>\n<li><strong>char(1)</strong> - <em>Store <strong>m</strong> or <strong>f</strong></em></li>\n<li><strong>Bit</strong> <em>(boolean)</em> - <em>and call the column isMale (sorry ladies :p)?</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>No sexist offense intended with option 3</em> :-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reason I ask</strong> is because of this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/204256/why-use-boolean-instead-of-char/204261#204261\">answer</a> which mentions that <strong>chars</strong> are <em>smaller</em> than <strong>booleans</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>\nI should clarify that I'm using MS SQL 2008, which <strong>DOES</strong> in fact have the bit datatype.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #2</strong><br>\nA few funny answers around more than 2 genders and using the isMale column.

It simply restricts the reader from seeing any intermediate, uncommitted, 'dirty' read. IT makes no promise whatsoever that if the transaction re-issues the read, will find the <em>Same</em> data, data is free to change after it was read.</p>\n\n<p>Repeatable read is a higher isolation level, that in addition to the guarantees of the read committed level, it also guarantees that any data read <em>cannot change</em>, if the transaction reads the same data again, it will find the previously read data in place, unchanged, and available to read.</p>\n\n<p>The next isolation level, serializable, makes an even stronger guarantee: in addition to everything repeatable read guarantees, it also guarantees that <em>no <strong>new</strong> data</em> can be seen by a subsequent read.</p>\n\n<p>Say you have a table T with a column C with one row in it, say it has the value '1'. And consider you have a simple task like following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BEGIN TRANSACTION;\nSELECT * FROM T;\nWAITFOR DELAY '00:01:00'\nSELECT * FROM T;\nCOMMIT;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is  a simple task that issue two reads from table T, with a delay of 1 minute between them. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>under READ COMITTED, the second SELECT may return <em>any</em> data. A concurrent transaction may update the record, delete it, insert new records. The second select will always see the <em>new</em> data.</li>\n<li>under REPEATABLE READ the second SELECT is guaranteed to see the rows that has seen at first select <em>unchanged</em>. New rows may be added by a concurrent transaction in that one minute, but the existing rows cannot be deleted nor changed.</li>\n<li>under SERIALIZABLE reads the second select is guaranteed to see <em>exactly</em> the same rows as the first.

SNAPSHOT isolation level makes the same guarantees as serializable, but not by requiring that no concurrent transaction can modify the data, but by making every reader see it's own version of the world (it's own 'snapshot').

Some of the following\n  questions may bias you toward a more\n  isolated approach, while others may\n  bias you toward a more shared\n  approach.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>How many prospective tenants do you expect to target? You may be nowhere\n  near being able to estimate\n  prospective use with authority, but\n  think in terms of orders of magnitude:\n  are you building an application for\n  hundreds of tenants? Thousands? Tens\n  of thousands? More? The larger you\n  expect your tenant base to be, the\n  more likely you will want to consider\n  a more shared approach.</p></li>\n  <li><p>How much storage space do you expect the average tenant's data to occupy?\n  If you expect some or all tenants to\n  store very large amounts of data, the\n  separate-database approach is probably\n  best. (Indeed, data storage\n  requirements may force you to adopt a\n  separate-database model anyway. If so,\n  it will be much easier to design the\n  application that way from the\n  beginning than to move to a\n  separate-database approach later on.)</p></li>\n  <li><p>How many concurrent end users do you expect the average tenant to support?\n  The larger the number, the more\n  appropriate a more isolated approach\n  will be to meet end-user requirements.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Do you expect to offer any per-tenant value-added services, such\n  as per-tenant backup and restore\n  capability? Such services are easier\n  to offer through a more isolated\n  approach.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Further to update about the expected number of tenants.</p>\n\n<p>That expected number of tenants (10k) should exclude the multi-database approach, for most, if not all scenarios. I don't think you'll fancy the idea of maintaining 10,000 database instances, and having to create hundreds of new ones every day.</p>\n\n<p>From that parameter alone, it looks like the shared-database, single-schema approach is the most suitable. The fact that you'll be storing just about 50Mb per tenant, and that there will be no per-tenant add-ons, makes this approach even more appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>The MSDN article cited above mentions three security patterns that tackle security considerations for the shared-database approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx#mlttntda_tdc\">Trusted Database Connections</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx#mlttntda_tvf\">Tenant View Filter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx#mlttntda_tde\">Tenant Data Encryption</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you are confident with your application's data safety measures, you would be able to offer your clients a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_agreement\">Service Level Agrement</a> that provides strong data safety guarantees.

Would wrapping that in a transaction do the same thing (ensuring no other connection attempts the same process while another is still processing)?  Or would a <code>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code> or <code>SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE</code> be better?</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>Locking tables prevents other DB users from affecting the rows/tables you've locked. But locks, in and of themselves, will NOT ensure that your logic comes out in a consistent state.</p>\n\n<p>Think of a banking system. When you pay a bill online, there's at least two accounts affected by the transaction: Your account, from which the money is taken. And the receiver's account, into which the money is transferred. And the bank's account, into which they'll happily deposit all the service fees charged on the transaction. Given (as everyone knows these days) that banks are extraordinarily stupid, let's say their system works like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$balance = \"GET BALANCE FROM your ACCOUNT\";\nif ($balance &lt; $amount_being_paid) {\n    charge_huge_overdraft_fees();\n}\n$balance = $balance - $amount_being paid;\nUPDATE your ACCOUNT SET BALANCE = $balance;\n\n$balance = \"GET BALANCE FROM receiver ACCOUNT\"\ncharge_insane_transaction_fee();\n$balance = $balance + $amount_being_paid\nUPDATE receiver ACCOUNT SET BALANCE = $balance\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, with no locks and no transactions, this system is vulnerable to various race conditions, the biggest of which is multiple payments being performed on your account, or the receiver's account in parallel. While your code has your balance retrieved and is doing the huge_overdraft_fees() and whatnot, it's entirely possible that some other payment will be running the same type of code in parallel. They'll be retrieve your balance (say, $100), do their transactions (take out the $20 you're paying, and the $30 they're screwing you over with), and now both code paths have two different balances: $80 and $70. Depending on which ones finishes last, you'll end up with either of those two balances in your account, instead of the $50 you should have ended up with ($100 - $20 - $30). In this case, \"bank error in your favor\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's say you use locks. Your bill payment ($20) hits the pipe first, so it wins and locks your account record. Now you've got exclusive use, and can deduct the $20 from the balance, and write the new balance back in peace... and your account ends up with $80 as is expected. But... uhoh... You try to go update the receiver's account, and it's locked, and locked longer than the code allows, timing out your transaction... We're dealing with stupid banks, so instead of having proper error handling, the code just pulls an <code>exit()</code>, and your $20 vanishes into a puff of electrons. Now you're out $20, and you still owe $20 to the receiver, and your telephone gets repossessed.</p>\n\n<p>So... enter transactions. You start a transaction, you debit your account $20, you try to credit the receiver with $20... and something blows up again. But this time, instead of <code>exit()</code>, the code can just do <code>rollback</code>, and poof, your $20 is magically added back to your account.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it boils down to this:</p>\n\n<p>Locks keep anyone else from interfering with any database records you're dealing with. Transactions keep any \"later\" errors from interfering with \"earlier\" things you've done. Neither alone can guarantee that things work out ok in the end. But together, they do.</p>\n\n<p>in tomorrow's lesson: The Joy of Deadlocks.</p>\n    "},{"t":"UPDATE and REPLACE part of a string","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17365222/update-and-replace-part-of-a-string","q":"\n\n<p>I've got a table with two columns, <code>ID</code> and <code>Value</code>.

This was a conscious decision made by the PostgreSQL team. A good overview of why and what you can do instead can be found <a href=\"http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/hinting_at_postgresql/\">here</a>. The reasons are basically that it's a performance hack that tends to cause more problems later down the line as your data changes, whereas PostgreSQL's optimizer can re-evaluate the plan based on the statistics. In other words, what might be a good query plan today probably won't be a good query plan for all time, and index hints force a particular query plan for all time.</p>\n\n<p>As a very blunt hammer, useful for testing, you can use the <code>enable_seqscan</code> and <code>enable_indexscan</code> parameters.

The sequence of numeric values is generated\n  in an ascending or descending order at a defined interval and may\n  cycle (repeat) as requested. Sequences, unlike identity columns, are\n  not associated with tables. An application refers to a sequence object\n  to receive its next value.

For information about\n  the options, see CREATE SEQUENCE.</p>\n  \n  <p>Unlike identity column values, which are generated when rows are\n  inserted, an application can obtain the next sequence number before\n  inserting the row by calling the NEXT VALUE FOR function. The sequence\n  number is allocated when NEXT VALUE FOR is called even if the number\n  is never inserted into a table.

I've read many of the previous discussions. I've got some additional questions though.</p>\n\n<p>I'm working on a legacy system with at least 100 tables. The database is has some un-normalized structure, tables that contain a variety of disparate data, and other problems. I've been given the task of trying to improve it. I can't just start again but need to modify the existing schema.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I have always tried to design normalized databases. Now the questions. A senior developer has suggested that in some cases we can't normalize:</p>\n\n<p>1) With temporal data. For example an invoice is created that links to a product. If a customer asks for a copy of this invoice a year later we must be able to produce an exact copy of the original. What if the product price, name or description have been updated? The senior guy suggested that the price and other product information should be copied to the invoice table. I'm thinking maybe we should have another table such as productPrice that has a date field so we can track changes in price over time. We would need the same thing for the product description and name I guess? Seems complicated. What do you think?</p>\n\n<p>2) The database is an accounting system. I'm not very familiar with accounting. At the moment some summary data is derived and stored in the database. For example total sales for the year. My senior associate has said that accountants like to check things are correct by comparing this value with data that is actually calculated from invoices etc to give them confidence that the application is working correctly. He said that at the moment for example we can tell if someone deleted an invoice from last year mistakenly because the totals will not be the same. He also pointed out that it could be quite slow to calculate these totals on the fly. Of course I said that data should not be duplicated and should always be calculated when needed. I suggested that we could use SQL Reporting Services or some other solution that will generate these reports overnight and cache them. Anyway he's not convinced.

You are better off starting from scratch, without them. Normalisation is complicated only to those who will not read books, and get their 'knowledge' from the amateurs at wiki.  It is fair enough that he makes you think, but some of the issues are absurd.</p>\n\n<p>Your numbers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You need to appreciate the differences between actual online data, and historic data; then the difference between merely historic and archival needs.  All of them are right for the specific business requirement, and wrong for all others, there is no universal right and wrong.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>why is there no paper-based copy of the invoice ?  In most countries that would be a legal and tax requirement, what exactly is the difficulty of fishing out the old invoice ?</li>\n<li>where the database has the <em>requirement</em> of storing the closed invoices, then sure, as soon as the invoice is closed, you need a method of capturing that information.</li>\n<li><code>ProductPrice</code> (actually, I would call it <code>ProductDate</code>) is a good idea, but may not be necessary. But you are right, you need to evaluate the currency of data, in the full context of the whole database.</li>\n<li>I cannot see how copying the product price to the invoice table would help (are not there many line items ?)</li>\n<li>in modern databases, where the <em>copy</em> of the invoice is required to be regurgitated, the closed Invoice is additionally stored in a different form, eg XML. One customer saves the PDFs as BLOBs. So there is no messing around with what the product price was five years ago.  But the basic invoice data is online and current, even for closed invoices; you just cannot recalculate ancient invoice using current prices.</li>\n<li>some people use an archive_invoice table, but that has problems because now every code segment or user report tool has to look in two places (note that these days some users understand databases better than most developers)</li>\n<li>Anyway, that is all discussion, for your understanding. None of the databases I have written in 30 years has ever had that sort of problem, and all of them comply with the legal and tax requirements.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>The database serves current and archival purposes from the one set of tables (no \"archive\" tables</li>\n<li>Once an Invoice is created, it is a legal document, and cannot be changed or deleted (it can be reversed or partially credited by a new Invoice, with negative values).  They are marked <code>IsIssued/IsPaid/Etc</code></li>\n<li><code>Products</code> cannot be deleted, they can be marked <code>IsObsolete</code></li>\n<li>There are separate tables for InvoiceHeader and InvoiceItem</li>\n<li><code>InvoiceItem</code> has FKs to both <code>InvoiceHeader</code> and <code>Product</code></li>\n<li>for many reasons (not only those you mention), the InvoiceItem row contains the <code>NumUnits; ProductPrice; TaxAmount; ExtendedPrice</code>.  Sure, this looks like a \"denormalisation\" but it is not, because prices, taxation rates, etc, are subject to change.  But more important, the legal requirement is that we can reproduce the old invoice on demand.</li>\n<li>(where it can be reproduced from paper files, this is not required)</li>\n<li>the <code>InvoiceTotalAmount</code> is a derived column, just <code>SUM()</code> of the InvoiceItems<br>\n.  </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>That is rubbish.  Accounting systems, and accountants do not \"work\" like that.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If it is a true accounting system, then it will have JournalEntries, or \"double entry\"; that is what a qualified account is required to use (by law).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Double Entry does not mean duplicate entry; it means every financial transaction (one amount) shall have a source account and target account that it is applied to; so there is no \"denormalisation\" or duplication.  In a banking database, because the financial transactions are against single accounts, that is commonly rendered as two separate financial transactions (rows) within one Db Transaction.  Ordinary commercial database constraints are used to ensure that there are two \"sides\" to every financial transaction.<br>\n.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Ensuring that Invoices are not deleteable is a separate issue, to do with security, etc.  if anyone is paranoid about things being deleted from their database, <strong>and</strong> their database was not secured by a qualified person, then they have more and different problems that have nothing to do with this question.  Obtain a security audit, and do whatever they tell you.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>There are a few people on this site who think wiki is a place that you can learn something.  It isn't.  It is a cesspool of \"definitions\" written by amateurs, and the \"definitions\" are constantly changed by other amateurs.  No fixed definition that you can rely on.  So don't worry about what wiki says or what people say wiki says, the moment they mention wiki, you know their \"knowledge\" come from reading not qualification; and what they are reading is an ever-changing cesspit. They will predictably argue about \"definitions\" because they have no actual experience; the experienced will just get on with the job</em></p></li>\n<li><p>A Normalised database is always much faster than Unnormalised database.  So it is very important to understand what Normalisation and Denormalisaion is, and what it isn't.  The process is greatly hindered when people have fluid and amateur \"definitions\", it just leads to confusion and time-wasting \"discussions\".  When you have fixed definitions, you can avoid all that, and just get on with the job.</p></li>\n<li><p>Summary tables are quite normal, to save the time and processing power, of recalculating info that does not change, eg: YTD totals for every year but this year; MTD totals for every month in this year but not this month. \"Always recalculating\" data is a bit silly when (a) the info is very large and (b) does not change.  Calculate for the current month only</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In banking systems (millions of Trades per day), at EndOfDay, we calculate and store Daily Total as well.

This is often referred to by people as \"Google like\" searching. </p>\n\n<p>Also, you may be interested in looking at the MoreLikeThisHandler, that was designed to provide hits that are similar to a specific document (for example from a previous search result).</p>\n\n<p>Note that as a source of confusion, the DisMaxRequestHandler in newer versions of Solr is actually provided by the default SearchHandler with a query type of <em>dismax</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Handlers are configured in <em>solrconfig.xml</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;requestHandler name=\"dismax\" class=\"solr.SearchHandler\" &gt;\n&lt;lst name=\"defaults\"&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"defType\"&gt;dismax&lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"echoParams\"&gt;explicit&lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;float name=\"tie\"&gt;0.01&lt;/float&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"qf\"&gt;\n    id^10.0 keyword^1.5 title^1.0 region^0.5 country^0.5 city^0.5\n &lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"pf\"&gt;\n    keyword^1.5 title^1.0 region^0.5 country^0.5 city^0.5\n &lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"bf\"&gt;\n &lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"mm\"&gt;\n    2&amp;lt;-1 5&amp;lt;-2 6&amp;lt;90%\n &lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;int name=\"ps\"&gt;100&lt;/int&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"q.alt\"&gt;*:*&lt;/str&gt;\n\n &lt;!-- example highlighter config, enable per-query with hl=true --&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"hl.fl\"&gt;text features name&lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;!-- for this field, we want no fragmenting, just highlighting --&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"f.name.hl.fragsize\"&gt;0&lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;!-- instructs Solr to return the field itself if no query terms are\n      found --&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"f.name.hl.alternateField\"&gt;name&lt;/str&gt;\n &lt;str name=\"f.text.hl.fragmenter\"&gt;regex&lt;/str&gt; &lt;!-- defined below --&gt;\n&lt;/lst&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In this case, <em>qf</em> are the fields and boosts to apply for each field. The above configuration will search across id, keyword, title, region, country and city. Check out the corresponding Wiki page for more info (DisMaxRequestHandler applies).</p>\n\n<p>The most effective way to use them is certainly to first know what exactly you want to achieve, then find the best match in terms of the handler, and then subsequently tune the configuration to provide the results you and your community would expect.</p>\n\n<p>Response writers are plugins (modules of logic) that will provide the ways and means to write responses in specific formats. Currently this concept applies mainly to searches, where you will be dealing with derivatives of the QueryResponseWriter, which in turn will be selected by the response format parameter <strong>wt</strong> (in the query).</p>\n\n<p>If you are working with PHP, then you will certainly be interested in generating PHP friendly responses to your requests, using <em>wt=php</em> or <em>wt=phps</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>php</em> response can be evaled:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$code = file_get_contents('http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=iPod&amp;wt=php');\neval(\"\\$result = \" . $code . \";\");\nprint_r($result);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the <em>phps</em> response can be read with PHP's serialization mechanism:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$serializedResult = file_get_contents('http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=iPod&amp;wt=phps');\n$result = unserialize($serializedResult);\nprint_r($result);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is support for others (like Ruby, Python, Java Binary, etc), which essentially have been build to make it easier for developers to integrate SOLR into their web applications using mechanisms that are faster than parsing XML or JSON.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are are also other types of ResponseWriter's that actually <em>transform</em> the response based on a template (e.g. Velocity) or a transform (e.g. XSLT). This can be useful in certain situations, where you don't want to depend on another application to process the query results (e.g. XSLT directly into XHTML).</p>\n\n<p>Response Writers are also configured in the <em>solrconfig.xml</em>, normally you will enable those that you are interested in e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;queryResponseWriter name=\"xml\" class=\"org.apache.solr.request.XMLResponseWriter\" default=\"true\"/&gt;\n&lt;queryResponseWriter name=\"json\" class=\"org.apache.solr.request.JSONResponseWriter\"/&gt;\n&lt;queryResponseWriter name=\"php\" class=\"org.apache.solr.request.PHPResponseWriter\"/&gt;\n&lt;queryResponseWriter name=\"phps\" class=\"org.apache.solr.request.PHPSerializedResponseWriter\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The most effective way to use them depends on your environment and what you want to achieve. Obviously if you are in PHP, a <em>phps</em> may give you better (easy access through the language) and faster (built-in serialization mechanism, less verbose) results. If in Javascript, <em>json</em> may just be the way to go etc.</p>\n\n<p>You see, SOLR is a powerful and versatile plattform :)\nIf you want to figure a way through the jungle you may want to resort to some book, like <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/solr-1-4-enterprise-search-server\">\"Solr 1.4 Enterprise Search Server\"</a> (although I am not sure it really does the best possible job as an introduction). Many things you can best figure out by trial-and-error as well as patience and some online help.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps to get you going.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Convert Rows to columns using 'Pivot' in SQL Server","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15931607/convert-rows-to-columns-using-pivot-in-sql-server","q":"\n\n<p>Well I guess I am really dense.

I'm mentioning my particular technologies only because I cannot use, for example, the replication features available to MySQL.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the client-server data synchronization problem has been around for a long, long time and would like information - articles, books, advice, etc - about patterns for handling the problem. I'd like to know about general strategies for dealing with synchronization to compare strengths, weaknesses and trade-offs.</p>\n    ","a":"\n<p>The first thing you have to decide is a general policy about which side is considered \"authoritative\" in case of conflicting changes.</p>\n\n<p>I.e.: suppose Record #125 is changed on the server on January 5th at 10pm and the same record is changed on one of the phones (let's call it Client A) on January 5th at 11pm. \nLast synch was on Jan 3rd. Then the user reconnects on, say, January 8th.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying what needs to be changed is \"easy\" in the sense that both the client and the server know the date of the last synch, so anything <em>created or updated</em> (see below for more on this) since the last synch needs to be reconciled.</p>\n\n<p>So, suppose that the only changed record is #125.\nYou either decide that one of the two automatically \"wins\" and overwrites the other, or you need to support a reconcile phase where a user can decide which version (server or client) is the correct one, overwriting the other.</p>\n\n<p>This decision is extremely important and you must weight the \"role\" of the clients. Especially if there is a potential conflict not only between client and server, but in case different clients can change the same record(s).</p>\n\n<p>[Assuming that #125 can be modified by a second client (Client B) there is a chance that Client B, which hasn't synched yet, will provide yet another version of the same record, making the previous conflict resolution moot]</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the \"<em>created or updated</em>\" point above... how can you properly identify a record if it has been originated on one of the clients (assuming this makes sense in your problem domain)?\nLet's suppose your app manages a list of business contacts. If Client A says you have to add a newly created John Smith, and the server has a John Smith created yesterday by Client D... do you create two records because you cannot be certain that they aren't different persons? Will you ask the user to reconcile this conflict too?</p>\n\n<p>Do clients have \"ownership\" of a subset of data? I.e. if Client B is setup to be the \"authority\" on data for Area #5 can Client A modify/create records for Area #5 or not? (This would make some conflict resolution easier, but may prove unfeasible for your situation).</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up the main problems are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How to define \"identity\" considering that detached clients may not have accessed the server before creating a new record.</li>\n<li>The previous situation, no matter how sophisticated the solution, may result in data duplication, so you must foresee how to periodically solve these and how to inform the clients that what they considered as \"Record #675\" has actually been merged with/superseded by Record #543</li>\n<li>Decide if conflicts will be resolved by <em>fiat</em> (e.g. \"The server version always trumps the client's if the former has been updated since the last synch\") or by manual intervention</li>\n<li>In case of <em>fiat</em>, especially if you decide that the client takes precedence, you must also take care of how to deal with other, not-yet-synched clients that may have some more changes coming.</li>\n<li>The previous items don't take in account the granularity of your data (in order to make things simpler to describe). Suffice to say that instead of reasoing at the \"Record\" level, as in my example, you may find more appropriate to record change at the field level, instead.

For example, this limitation applies to statements of\n  the following forms:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DELETE FROM t WHERE ... (SELECT ... FROM t ...);\nUPDATE t ... WHERE col = (SELECT ... FROM t ...);\n{INSERT|REPLACE} INTO t (SELECT ... FROM t ...);\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Exception: The preceding prohibition does not apply if you are using a subquery for the modified table in the FROM clause. Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>UPDATE t ... WHERE col = (SELECT * FROM (SELECT ... FROM t...) AS _t ...);\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Here the result from the subquery in the FROM clause is stored as a temporary table, so the relevant rows in t have already been selected by the time the update to t takes place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That last bit is your answer. Select target IDs in a temporary table, then delete by referencing the IDs in that table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DELETE FROM instructor WHERE id IN (\n  SELECT temp.id FROM (\n    SELECT id FROM instructor WHERE salary BETWEEN 13000 AND 15000\n  ) AS temp\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/47921/1\">SQLFiddle demo</a>.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Javascript libraries that allow for SQL-like queries on JSON data?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4720494/javascript-libraries-that-allow-for-sql-like-queries-on-json-data","q":"\n\n<p>Say our JSON data comes from a single MySQL table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>someJSON =    [ { name: 'bill' , sex:'M', income:50000 },\n                { name: 'sara' , sex:'F', income:100000 },\n                 ...\n               ];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And say the pseudo-code is: </p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Get all the person objects of all <code>sex:F</code> of <code>income</code> &gt; 60000`\".</strong></p>\n\n<p>Are there any javascript libraries that would allow one to code such queries on this JSON data using a SQL or SQL-like syntax.</p>\n\n<p>In case you are curious, some context: </p>\n\n<p>I am making the front-end of a data analysis web service for my organization without knowing what the future backend will be.

Every table used them except one, which used a key made up of the first name, last name and birthdate of a person. Anyways, people started running into a lot of problems with duplicates, as tables representing relationships could hold the same relationship twice or more. I decided to get around this by implementing composite keys for the relationship tables and I haven't had a problem with duplicates since. </p>\n\n<p>So I was wondering what's the deal with the bad rep of composite keys in the Access world? I guess it's slightly more difficult to write a query, but at least you don't have to put in place tons of checks every time data is entered or even edited in the front end.

Contract classes are not included automatically\n  with a provider; the provider's developer has to define them and then\n  make them available to other developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having said that, you do not necessarily need a Content Provider to use a Contract class. My example contains constants that are used by the Content Provider (The MIME and URI parts). If you are not using a Content Provider, you do not need these sections. </p>\n\n<p>I like to think of the contract class as a database schema, or in other words something that defines how your database is set up. You might notice that everything within the contract class is declared as static. That is because you will never be instantiating a Contract class, but only referring to the constants defined in it. You can see in my example that my Contract class just has a bunch of static final variables declared. This Contract class can be its own file, e.g. my file is called TransitContract.java.</p>\n\n<p>Say for example you wanted to change the name of one of your columns. Rather than making changes to multiple files, all you have to do is change the value for the column in the contract class.\nYou are not doing any kind of computation work inside of the contract class. </p>\n\n<p>The SQLLiteOpenhelper class on the other hand is something that was provided by Google to make working with databases easier. This is where you implement methods that create and set up the initial database. See <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html\">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html</a>. After you implement these methods, all you have to do is instantiate an instance of your helper class, and then call helperClassInstance.getWriteableDatabase() (or getReadableDataBase()) and then your helper class automatically takes care of creating a new database if necessary, or returning the one that already exists, etc.</p>\n\n<p>This helper is generally implemented as an inner class but could be its own standalone class. It's however you want to implement it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I highly recommend looking at the Notepad example that Google provides as it has a pretty good example of how you could possibly set a contract class up. Please note that they also use a Content Provider. If you are interested in learning about Content Providers I recommend you read up some more at <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html\">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html</a>.

In this case hive can return the results by performing an hdfs operation. <code>hadoop fs -get</code>, more or less.</p>\n\n<p>A hive query can be a Map Reduce job.</p>\n\n<p>Hive has to ship the jar to hdf's, the job tracker queues the tasks, the task tracker execute the tasks, the final data is put into hdf's or shipped to the client.</p>\n\n<p>The Map Reduce job has different possibilities as well.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a Map only job. <code>Select * from table where id &gt; 100</code>, for example all of that logic can be applied on the mapper.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a Map and Reduce job, <code>Select min(id) from table;</code> <code>Select * from table order by id;</code></p>\n\n<p>It can also lead to multiple map Reduce passes, but I think the above summarizes some behaviors.</p>\n    "},{"t":"How to get time part from SQL Server 2005 datetime in 'HH:mm tt' format","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3201432/how-to-get-time-part-from-sql-server-2005-datetime-in-hhmm-tt-format","q":"\n\n<p>How to get time part from SQL Server 2005 datetime in <code>HH:mm tt</code> format </p>\n\n<p>E.g. </p>\n\n<pre><code>11:25 AM\n14:36 PM\n</code></pre>\n    ","a":"\n<p>One way is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT LTRIM(RIGHT(CONVERT(VARCHAR(20), GETDATE(), 100), 7))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you have a look at <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspx\">Books Online here</a>, format 100 is the one that has the time element in the format you want it in, it's just a case of stripping off the date from the front.</p>\n    "},{"t":"Is there a way to define a named constant in a PostgreSQL query?","l":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13316773/is-there-a-way-to-define-a-named-constant-in-a-postgresql-query","q":"\n\n<p>Is there a way to define a named constant in a PostgreSQL query?
